1293613,16.0,0,You need to seek mental health help buddy.  What youre describing is eerily similar to gambling addiction.  The fact that you think you can even chase your losses by taking another loan further contributes to the view that youre struggling with a very real mental health issue.    Im not sure what youd get by trolling us with a fake story as were not even a large sub so how much karma can you rake in? so Ill give you the benefit of the doubt and assume youre being honest.  Please get help. And please do not take out a loan. Take a break from bitcoin. Forget the dream of making money quick.

1293627,23.0,0,The problem they segwit authors are trying to solve can be solved in about  new lines of code. They did it in many thousands.  The reason for this is that they held themselves to avoid one step which is to have a hard fork. They required to do it as a soft fork instead.  So what they could have done is  . change the transaction format.  What they changed instead is  . how transactionscripts are found . how transactions are transferred over the pp network. . how transactions are stored in a block. . we now have relevant data in the coinbase transaction. . block size calculations are changed. . sigop limits are changed . it changes the bitcoinaddress type people can use . a whole new datastructure is added which is consensus critical . introduces new opcodes to fix problems found after the above were done. . how signatures are validated quite extensively.  They even made clear at the Milan meeting they were proud that this change touches all parts of Bitcoin. That is not something to be proud of that is something that should tell you that its not done right.  The sad part here is that the entire reason for doing it as a soft fork is to make sure that most parts of the network dont have to upgrade and thus make it much safer to roll out. The reality is that practically all of the ecosystem will need to upgrade to get this working and on top of that the much higher complexity over a competing solution safe.,2016-12-13T16:37:31.000Z,0.25
1293628,174.0,0,Exactly. The only evidence that has been offered so far is the use of Russianderrived hacking tools that Kaspersky has published extensively on and which are available on the deep web to anyone with a small Bitcoin wallet.   I can say with experience though that Russian statesponsored cyber attacks dont leave neat breadcrumb trails to follow and they dont use twogeneration old hacking tools that anyone in the world can obtain.   ....but even if it was the Russian government its not like they fabricated anything. All the information was genuine and true so if voters made choices based on that information then instead of blaming Russia the DNC should be trying to avoid including despicable people who would do that sort of shit to begin with.

1293633,-4.0,0,A year and a half of urgency.  Haha.  Guys quick.  Its urgent!  In a year I am going to have a heart attack.  A year and a half later.  Theres still a sense of urgency!  I havent had a heart attack yet.  You need to consider what urgent means.  And changing its meaning is a cheap equivocation that will not work on any reader in a thread Im participating.  To be clear this was the prediction of the poisonous person  gtnever have blocks that are  full all of the time  gtIf the number of transactions waiting gets large enough the end result will be an oversaturated network busy doing nothing productive. I dont think that is likely it is more likely people just stop using Bitcoin because transaction confirmation becomes increasingly unreliable.  All wrong.  The blocks filled and the network keeps on being productive to process transactionsthe higher fees go first.  And the market loves this behavior and therefore raises the value.  There was never any urgency.  And Gavin knew it.  He was just being that poisonous person that claims the world is ending.  That poisonous person who writes a post about poisonous people just to attack ulukejr one of the most genuine smartest and hardworking developers we have.  And why did he do this?  Because Luke disagreed with him.  Gavin is the epitome of a poisonous person.  The only reason this community is even divided is because he selfishly did it to stroke his ego by accomplishing his agenda.  But he failed in his agenda leaving a mess in the wake.  He was miserably wrong about the urgent problem.  He was wrong about the market leaving.  And he lied about fake Satoshi.

1293634,25.0,0,gt First of all you are changing the serialization format. With an immutable dataset such as bitcoin this is a very high price to pay because it means that every software will have to support two completely different serialization formats indefinitely. You can never deprecate the existing format.  Although indefinitely might in theory mean forever I can imagine that a better serialization format will be used in . of cases in the future and at some point most wallets dropping support for it.  If you then come across an arcane oldtype transaction in the old format your wallet might signal an error and you might want to get an old client fired up to process that transaction  should you deal with that data directly.  But miners and full nodes probably need to support this forever or at least a very long time yes.  I think we should take some more time years to get this right. I think uThomasZanders efforts are promising but I really think we should think this through.  But this also is absolutely true for SegWit. Lets wait until after a blocksize increase and when the dust has settled on this issue and when the space might be again more polite and professional and less flamewars are fought.  Lets not rush something that needs support forever and lets not rush on touching what might be delicate tradeoffs between off and onchain transactions with SegWit either.

Censor all altclients which want to hardfork. And threaten to leave Bitcoin development for good and call it a complete faillure if a contentious hardfork were to happen.

This same thing could be said about rDarkNetMarkets. We know they prefer to stick to the gold standard of Bitcoin and we shouldnt take offense or keep pushing any kind of agenda over there. People here take pride that Monero speaks for itself if one takes the time to look into it... well how about lets let Monero do exactly just that?,2016-12-09T01:04:34.000Z,0.25

1293678,22.0,0,gt but it seems like the general threat is careless mining pools might get left behind for a bit.  I was thinking more of a deliberate attack.  I guess this can also happen by accident.  gt Do you think its much more serious than that?  Yes I do think this is a potentially very serious attack with severe impacts.  Please see me try to outline some below   During this attack there is effectively network downtime.  All a miner needs to do is produce a block to DoS the network.  In my view we should try to keep network downtime to a minimum   The resolution to this attack could take a while especially if the chain with larger blocks has the lead.  This is because we may need to wait for miners AD thresholds to be reached and AD can be a large value   The attacker can get  free assistance with a double spend attack.  For example existing light wallets such as the commonly used Breadwallet all have AD As far as I understand or it may be infinity which could be even worse for BU.  As an attacker I could make a payment to multiple Breadwallet users mine a median EB block and have  of the hashrate support my double spend attempt for free   Other users could see the split and opportunistically try to perform double spend attacks   This attack vector produces wasted work this reduces the efficiency and security of the network.  i.e. the total work of the chain deceases.   This may be of particular concern for BU which may be in a protracted battle with Core over who has the most work chain  gt  Can you think of any obvious tweaks to mitigate the impact of such an attack?  In my view BU somewhat alters the core longest chain rule idea any changes to this area are probably highly risky and highly complex.  They seem to take us right back to the core principals of the Bitcoin design which is the highly convergent nature of the system.  I therefore do not see any obvious think one could do in this area.  Personally I am strongly in favor of a dynamic market driven blocksize limit.  I support BIP which is where miners vote for whether the limit should go up or down.,2016-12-02T08:34:10.000Z,0.25
1293679,17.0,0,Listen I appreciate the sincerity but you also have to appreciate that I could just turn around and say see everyone this person is the exact troll I am talking about  Now even if you arent trolling you are going to feel a little pegged in front of the wrong audience right?  This is because you have tried to suggest you are both not ignorant AND ignorant at the same time in other words your post is inconsistent with itself.  When Satoshi announced the mb limit the IMMEDIATE subsequent posts were in regard to the socialpolitical difficulty of removing it in the future. MANY people or at least some intuitive ones immediately saw the problem  I have always looked at it and said its impossible to move at least especially in regard to making bitcoin a coffee money.   People that think its obvious that it will get removed and easily so do not understand the problem in the first place and this is why they think core is dumb.  When your conclusion is that smart people are dumb you need to rethink if bitcoin is simple or too complex for you to understand. It might be the latter and thus why you are at odds with the reality of the situation.

1293683,72.0,0,Hmmm this is worrying. Ive been lurking in various places following this so heres my explanation of whats been going on  Its widely theorized that Julian Assange was rendered on October . This triggered a Dead Mans Switch  an automatic release of Phase  of Wikileaks leaks this year. But to prevent tampering with the information hes hidden the information in the Bitcoin blockchain. As well as transaction information Bitcoin allows you to include files in a transaction. So what happened is   Julian didnt check in by Friday  Wikileaks automatically spent nearly all of its bitcoins sending payments around the network  included in those payments were damning leaks on  I believe   and Tavistock.   Because of the way Bitcoin works those leaks have now been replicated to every single box on the network that mines or verifies transactions. The blockchain is basically a giant ledger of every transaction thats ever been made. Its a big file Gb made of blocks that the whole network needs to verify Im skipping the details a bit. The point is that no one entity is large enough to take over the whole Bitcoin network because it requires too much processing power. This means that the blockchain is a place where you can store things that a cannot be deleted and b cannot be tampered with. Cablegate was released like this and is still there of course encrypted and split up over many transactions.   So what a bunch of groups have been doing is scanning the blockchain for transactions originating from and to Wikileaks from Oct  to Oct  to see if they can find the files and the instructions for decoding them. Its like putting a  piece jigsaw puzzle together where there are tens of thousands of other unrelated pieces in the pile. However they have been making progress. But the closer they get the more people seem to disappear and the more threads get deleted. And now endchan itself is unavailable.   EDIT endchan is back up!

1293691,22.0,0,Its a digital cryptographic money system usable by anyone and mostly outside of government control. Transactions happen directly peertopeer and are confirmed by a global network of nodes that maintain a massively distributed data structure known as the Blockchain. Though theyre divisible up to  decimal places technically more only a finite number of bitcoins will be produced. As time goes on and scarcity is slowly introduced BTC or XBT as some exchanges denote it is expected to increase in value.  Its not a perfect system there are people that will try to scam you and its sometimes threatened by governments and banks that believe they need to regulate it in many ways it is already selfregulating. But its actively developed open source software and has proven to be a good store of value and can quickly and cheaply be used to send cash between countries.  Before you buy any large amounts learn how wallets and private keys work. Avoid socalled bitcoin doublers cloud mining pyramid schemes and other types of scams.

I would bet that the falling ETH price is lighting a fire under many ETH DEVs butts bc many hold ETH to perhaps work harder than they would if we were still at a . cap.  As for the DAO yes I never see Ethereum mentioned outside this sub or the main Ethereum sub without seeing the DAO mentioned that is perhaps fair but what really has happened as a result of the DAO is much more nuanced than is what is usually portrayed by mainstream writers or Fudders.  The narrative goes the DAO was a disaster and caused Ethereum to crash.  Well yes but a more complete story is that the DAO caused Ethereum to become much much stronger with improved best practices better tools solidity language development and so on.  The a more complete picture is that big dapps like gnosis augur and Digix have been delayed by the DAO.   But this delay is making them stronger and the whole ecosystem stronger.

But go on pray for bigger blocks and the hope of making everything better.   The problem is Bitcoin being in hands of devs you trust. In a few years it will be a deadrunning into more problems or b hardening its code by itself and locking out all devs where AI comes into play. Yes yadahyadah future nonsense. Just wait. All signs point to this as the only possible solution because humans are not neutral enough. However this might happen. You just dont see the biggest problem hidden in plain sight. Devs selling you things and people asking real important questions being silenceddiscredited left and right.    There also will come the day when shocking millions of Bitcoin are cut outbeing set free for mining again. It already has been in talk long ago technically easy. You just dont believe it yet because you dont know how devs are going to sell users it as an upgradefeature with some other side effects covering personal interests of devs. Feel how you already fell for the blocksize thing? You might lose focus on other things happening.   Huge risk Satoshis coins. Or coins from someone slowly illegally acquiring millions over time to avoid a rollback to gain more power leading to a possible full resetreal huge rollbackcatastrophe. Its already happening since a long time. Nobody bats an eye. Ransomware hacked exchanges etc. until a group owns too much and shit hits the fan.    Also devs being able to cut coins off the network automatically leads to more possible stupidity and changing the m cap. Because nothing happens in a neutral way. Mining also is a problem. Its already in hands of big players  this shouldnt be possible in the first way. And you worry about block size.    Right now you think its all good because you trust in a promise of devs e.g. m coins. Trust in people still is a risk of Bitcoins future and breaking the very basic concept of a trustless financial system. Its not a trustless system... I wish it would be...

The decline has flattened off but it needs reversing.   The BU position is that if volumes can grow user counts grow market price increases then more people and businesses will run full nodes maintaining decentralization. There is more risk to Bitcoin from crippled throughput as this gives the alts possible future marketshare and there are thousands of people running altcoin nodes that could be running bitcoin nodes in the expectation that their alt will rival bitcoin in the longterm.,2016-12-28T19:33:42.000Z,0.0

And he knew prior to its creation that it would need additional rules that would be enforced by the consensus mechanism.  For instance the block reward amount was not defined in the paper.  Also the block time was not defined.  All of these type rules could be bikeshedded and added when actually creating the system and then they would be enforced by the consensus mechanism.  It doesnt mean that he intended to have a mechanism for changing the rules.  The white paper was a skeletal outline of a system that he was proposing to create.  That last sentence was telling how the meat would be added to create a working implementation.

1293736,28.0,0,The quote bold font included from article   gt I think theres a sense of entitlement where these companies want us to do something and were not getting paid anything by these people to do it I think that might not be morally correct. If anyone wants to build whatever they want to this everything is out in the open. All the source code is there. You can take it run with it and do whatever the hell you want with it. Were giving this to the world for free.  Its a perfectly valid point  business are taking advantage of opensource tech but not giving anything back except ways for them to make more money via the userbase. Businesses are not morally perfect they are the opposite by nature IMO. Sure they serve a useful purpose but the fact is that those same services could be provided by smaller companies all working together without the overarching parent company to rule them all. Its fine to have some solid businesses in place but if they could be broken up over time to give more control of the community back to the community itself that might be neat. A community that employs itself to keep itself running and decentralized...it sounds neat anyways.  Businesses trying to take advantaged of Bitcoin need to determine whats more important this early on Profit or the technology. Right now the answer should always be the technology and if profit can be made at the same time so be it...but using Bitcoin to attain profitriches goes against the entire concept AFAIK.

1293745,-4.0,0,gt But it doesnt have to be so expensive small blocks mean less expenses to spam the blockchain with transactions driving fees to in my opinion silly heights. More blockspace means more costs to spam a full block with transactions MB doubles the transaction count from what we now have MB would quadruple it if not more.  Reality has proven otherwise. Every time the block size increased spam expanded to fill it. Spammers are also not the ones paying the fees  they found ways to get others to pay it for them a long time ago.  gt But Lightning isnt Bitcoin right?  It is actually. Lightning is just smartoptimised use of Bitcoins builtin smart contract system.  gt What will be the requirements of a Lightning node for me the average user? Im running an Unlimited node just fine what incentive do I have to run a Lightning node as well? That just seems like doing double the amount of work.  Requirements should be lower than running a full node. The primary incentive is typically instant confirmation.  gt Thats true if we could run an SPV off of a Bitcoin Unlimited or Core or any node that would be best because you wouldnt have to trust another node. Maybe thats a good thing to look into?  People have looked into it. Thats how we realised it wasnt actually possible.   Fraud proofs are used to detect invalid blocks. But the problem is those invalid blocks have no reason to be wellformed and can therefore be carefully constructed such as to make a fraud proof impossible. For example by having a corrupt merkle tree that affects only a single transaction nobody cares about.  gt But isnt it the whole point of transactions to be recorded in the Blockchain? Because to me it seems that this whole Lightning thing just makes users transact tokens to one another without directly touching the blockchain the whole point of Bitcoin is irreversible instant transactions for none to low fees.  The blockchain does not provide irreversible instant transactions at all. Lightning does that. The blockchain is also inherently expensive. The catch with Lightning is that it only works with the blockchain backing it up. Its only with both the blockchain and Lightning that Bitcoin can accomplish the goals you and many others have for it.  gt How is it broken? According to this post the consensus system works just fine. How does BU in your view break the consensus? By giving users a choice?  Unless all users choose the same thing blocks can be constructed which some users accept and others do not. This splits the system into two parallel and competing blockchains effectively creating an altcoin for each user under scenarios where even a single miner is hostile. With such an environment a single block confirmation provides no security whatsoever and even with more blocks the relative security is reduced. BU does typically have a point where it will accept any block size up to some hard limit regardless of user preference so I suppose there might be a certain confirmation eventually after a day or two? but even that breaks down if miners continue to build their parallel blockchains which is the default behaviour.  gt Bitcoin Unlimited wont need a fork of any kind it will accept the new blocksize without question  That is by definition a hardfork! Removing a rule such as the  MB block size limit  hardfork.  gt leave it at EBAD by default.  Even this is a hardfork because it relaxes the  MB block size limit rule such that it ceases to apply if buried under enough work.  gt If someone explicitly doesnt like it they can let their accepted size stay what it is and they would still follow consensus if bigger blocks would be created.  Its not consensus if anyone doesnt like it. Nodes dont follow consensus they decide consensus.  gt Segwit isnt a blocksize increase it removes safety features as I have understood it from the transaction hash in order to reduce the size a transaction uses on the blockchain.  Youve been lied to. The transaction size isnt reduced at all nor are any features removed.  gt That aside softforks seem to be more opposed to hardforks if Ive read the subreddits correctly  Only on this mostlytroll subreddit. Most of rBitcoin which is much larger is the complete opposite and even the entirety of reddit is only a small portion of the entire Bitcoin community.  gt Yes but if the people are unaware of a choice its not really a choice is it?

1293746,16.0,0,Wow.   Bitcoin has steadily grown for  years. You cant dispute this fact because its public data.  The blocksize has also steadily grown and started to hit the MB limit about  months ago.  It is irrelevant if you think this is a spam attack or not or if you blame a forum which is insane its a forum not an organization or a development team which is ridiculous and a shitty thing to do.  The fact is we now have a steady volume of Bitcoin transactions that runs at close to max capacity. If the block solution rate slows down or if someone transmits more transactions than normal it will cause a backlog.  The refusal of core to increase the limit has made Bitcoin vulnerable. It is irrelevant whether they are spam or not. Core dropped the ball. This is why so many people are pissed off over at rbtc and why the China community is ready to throw core out and adopt BU.   Keep calling it spam and do nothing. Well switch to BU.,2016-12-02T01:25:51.000Z,0.25

1293753,24.0,0,gtI see that this sub tends to largely lean towards onchain only.  I have no idea where people get this idea. Any quotes? As far as I can tell  and I read this forum daily and post a ton  no one here is opposed to offchain scaling. The only opposition is to delaying blocksize cap increases for asyet unreleased offchain possibilities.  gtIve heard some people saying that changing block size is as simple as changing a single number but then Ive heard developers saying just the opposite and that the actual act of forking needs to be tried on testnet.   Its a bit more complicated than that but not much. Some devs like to make a talking point of this but they just mean Merely changing the number doesnt make the network able to handle that number. But almost everyone agrees  to  MB would be fine. Forking itself is something that has been done. I dont know that there are particular concerns about a blocksize increase fork itself on a technical basis. The concerns are about a slippery slope where we keep increasing the blocksize cap until no one but major data centers can run a node. This continues to strike me as a silly argument because miners and all other major stakeholders have every interest in not weakening Bitcoin. Humans react to changing circumstances and incentives very unlike an icy mountain terrain.  gtIve heard many whispers of nefarious motives behind core coming from this sub with lots of mention of Blockstream.  Its just what it looks like. Blockstream is a company that employs many of the most influential Core devs and they seem to be developing offchain scaling solutions for profit with  million in venture capital on the line looking for at least a x return. The debate regarding blocksize is largely about how much to scale onchain vs. how much to scale offchain and since around the time of Blockstreams founding Core has been tilting ever more staunchly toward offchain scaling. Segwit provides a small blocksize quasiincrease if the right conditions are met but with strings attached it gives a x discount to the kinds of transactions Blockstream would likely be making heavy use of in their business. This has people suspicious for all the obvious reasons though nothing can be proven.,2016-12-04T12:38:41.000Z,0.25

1293756,45.0,0,Yeah MB forever is entirely survivable.  Lightning relies on all participants making a few onchain transactions every once in a while so while all current traffic and then some would comfortably work it wouldnt scale indefinitely on the main chain.  Probably one or more highvolume sidechains would be created for both direct transfers and eventually any Lightning channelopenclose transactions that dont fit on the main chain. There are three types of sidechain that could be used for this   SPVsecurity sidechains and drivechains rely on the majority of Bitcoin miners being trustworthy. A majority of miners could steal all BTC on the sidechain. Bitcoin proper doesnt have this flaw. I think that this type of sidechain would only be reasonable for small values experimentation microtransactions etc.  Federatedsecurity sidechains use signing by a group of centralized functionaries instead of mining. If there are many functionaries in many different countries then IMO this is more secure than the above sidechain types even though it is technically centralized. It can also have very short times between blocks. Thisd be OK for somewhat higher values IMO.  Bitcoinsecurity sidechains have the same security as Bitcoin but this requires a softfork in Bitcoin and then all Bitcoin full nodes must also be full nodes on the sidechain so maybe this violates your assumption of no successful softforkshardforks. Though the previouslymentioned sidechain types can usually be converted into Bitcoinsecurity sidechains at any point after their creation so this is an especially easy upgrade path by the time theres a desire to make a sidechain Bitcoinsecure itll probably be welltested and popular.  Alternatively or additionally to sidechains you could do some of these things   Blinded bearer certificates allow a bank which may actually be a multisig arrangement requiring signatures from many independent parties to issue bearer certificates which can be redeemed for onchain BTC or transferred to other people. Transferring bearer certificates involves giving the recipient a signed transaction which they then register with the bank to prevent doublespending. Because blind signing is used this is more anonymous than Bitcoin Monero and even Mimblewimble. It is also extremely efficientscalable. A wallet based on these certificates might ask the user to say something like I trust Bank with x BTC Bank with y BTC etc. and then the wallet could automatically diversify among certificates issued by these different banks in order to reduce overall risk.  Everyone could open a verylonglasting payment channel with one hub of their choice and then there would be a network of longlasting payment channels between all of the hubs. Transferring BTC to someone would go from you to your hub maybe through some intermediate hubs to the recipients hub to them all through payment channels which probably already exist. There would be only a few main hubs though the only barrier to creating new hubs would be somewhat higher costs sort of like how email works. This is called the hubandspoke idea and it results in significantly fewer onchain transactions than Lightning which doesnt have hubs.  Before the current incarnation of Ripple the idea of Ripple was something different. It was sort of like Lightning but using debt and trust rather than guaranteed payment channels. You would say Im willing to loan  BTC to Alice and Bob and then maybe Bob would say Im willing to loan  BTC to Carol. Then if Carol sends  BTC to you this is executed by Bob loaning  BTC to Carol and you loaning  BTC to Bob so no onchain transaction is necessary. Later on if Bob wants to pay you you just reduce his debt again without needing an onchain transaction. Onchain settlements would occasionally be necessary but as the trust graph grows they become increasingly rare. If  of Bitcoin users used this system and formed a connected trust graph then I think that no onchain transactions would be strictly necessary. The main downside of this system is that it is somewhat fragile ie. if you trust someone incorrectly then you can lose BTC.  Note that this has very little to do with the design of todays Ripple whose usage of the name Ripple was a horrible baitandswitch.  Now I dont think that itd be very good for Bitcoin to be MBforever   Most of the above solutions have some downside usually increased centralization. While centralization in upper layers is better than allowing Bitcoin proper to become insecure or centralized its still not ideal. Lightning is nice because it combines many of the benefits of these more centralized systems without actually requiring any centralizationtrust but it does require some onchain transactions. So itd be really good if Bitcoin can at least handle enough transaction volume for most people to comfortably use Lightning. And in fact I suspect that increasing the max block size to levels required by Lightning will when necessary not actually be controversial. Were not even close to needing this right now.  Switching from todays Bitcoin to a mostlysettlementonly Bitcoin would be really jarring. Theres a lot of distance between where we are now and where wed need to be in that sort of environment in wallet design user expectationstraining the overall ecosystem etc. If all work on scaling suddenly stopped today I think that we would quite quickly find the need to make this transition and most Bitcoiners would find the process to be very uncomfortable.  Im not sure about this but I kinda feel that itd be ideal for people to always be able to do large transactions gt or so directly onchain. Itd be like the difference between wire transfers and ACH transfers in the US. Then you can keep most of your BTC directly on the Bitcoin main chain as a sort of ultrahighsecurity Swiss bank account and you dont need to rely too much on possiblylesssecure layer solutions.,2016-12-05T07:52:01.000Z,0.25

Ive been saying this for a long time and completely agree average consumers will be the last ones to the party. Notice that when many people dismiss bitcoin the first thing they point to is the unlikeliness of it displacing traditional payments because it isnt any more convenient or faster for the consumer.   Viewing bitcoin through the lens of the consumer as the sole or primary criteria for its prospects is coming from people not very familiar with the inner workings of the world of money finance and power. They are just viewing bitcoin as a consumer product like the iPhone. Money doesnt work that way people dont use their national currencies because they simply represent the best product.

1293769,22.0,0,A decentralized VPN has already been around for a very long time its called Tor.  The only thing youre discouraged to do with Tor is torrenting. And its performance may be slower than a regular VPN. But incentivization in Tor has also been long discussed alone it lacks implementation so far. I think IP has some torrenting app. Theres also Retroshare but it might feel too clumsy for some.  An anonymous VPN provider in this network as described in the article is basically a Tor Exit Node and comes with all sorts of legal problems. So not every user can become a VPN provider so easily. Its not just like spinning up a Bitcoin or Ethereum node theres much more to it than that.,2016-12-02T14:47:41.000Z,0.25
1293770,21.0,0,I think this joke of ether has no value its only gas for smart contracts is really dull and getting old. It made sense to say this  years ago when Ethereum didnt want to appear too dangerous to the Bitcoin community.  But honestly I think this is the wrong approach. Instead ether should be promoted as a store of value. Monetary creation should be much lower M ether are created every month.  This rationale was maybe great in September  but today its definitely hurting Ethereum.  I believe that we should reduce the block reward of  ether per block to  or  ether per block thereby reducing the inflation massively by the way the difficulty bomb is coming what a nice coincidence. It would not hurt the security of the platform at all we may just need to wait a few confirmations more for high value transfers as the hashrate would drop proportionally.  The security of blockchain platforms past a certain point of popularity has almost never depended upon their hashrate. When was the last time any of you experienced a pure hashrate based  attack on a platform with a marketcap higher than M? Never most likely.  The truth is that security depends more on the codebase of the platform than on its hashrate just look at the history of the Ethereum platform especially the last  months every time there was a security issue it was never because of the hashrate but instead because of some bug in the consensus layer or a denial of service attack. Also lower inflation is positive to the development of the platform as the .M ether that the Ethereum Foundation holds would be less likely to lose their value thereby enabling it to pay salaries and make Ethereums codebase better and more secure.,2016-12-03T13:47:39.000Z,0.25

Technically gold doesnt have a market cap either but everyone knows what you mean when you talk about the market cap of gold.

1293777,25.0,0,Hey dear ethtraders and bitcointraders as well today I will not do extensive TA no charts... because I take have some time off in the next days. I will give a quick rundown of the most liquid coins.  BTCEUR  Finally Bitcoin is taking off surging into the daily overbought territory. Consequently it has to retrace a bit as shortterm traders need to take their profits. However I think this red candle right now is minor. I do not exclude the possibility that we could range for a few days in the current region but it has to go higher. The dips are bought up quickly and the moon sentiment is not yet unequivocal so I think there is room to go up. Target price predictions are off the charts as I dont see any tangible resistances right now. So I think it is still bullish.  ETHBTC  I do not believe in the double bottom yet at least the volumes dont show heavy skirmishes where bulls are winning. I think we should see some consolidation in the  range but only do get out of oversold levels. I had bought some ETH recently because it looked like it would withstand the Bitcoin pressure but it didnt. I will probably cut some of my long position somewhere in the  range. What happens afterwards I dont see yet but it fully depends on Bitcoin which is likely to go up again. In conclusion I think we will go sideways with bearish bias.  Note that this time I am looking at the ETHBTC chart not the fiat chart. The reason is that currently the ratio to BTC is more reliable as most positions are installed from BTC longs since this is where the money flow is happening. The fiat volume to ETH seems to follow the ratio quite reliably.  XMRBTC  A few days ago the GUI was finally released resulting in a small upward surge which was fend off decisively at .. I do not see this resistance breaking anytime soon at least not with Bitcoin going up some more. But I think there is fuel left to charge again at this resistance but the volumes are not convincing so I think the upside is capped. On the support side the . level still held in the past days so I think that the weak trend will result in further sideways movement.  Wildcards  Last week I have discussed ICNBTC where I have concluded that the news will and should be sold in the following days.

1293778,15.0,0,gt Fair enough but I have a hard time believing that Bitcoins inability to scale is the reason for them pivoting. I think it rather has to do with their lack of growth which all digital currency companies are struggling with by the way. This has more to do with a lack of interest in Bitcoin and this does not have much to do with scaling.

If you were on a bitcoin money system your debt would have increased this year by in dollars plus interest charges. Your bitcoin denominated income would decrease. So the real value of the debt would burden you.  Of course hyperinflation is not good but plenty of economies have grown at double digit rates under  annual inflation because it reduces debt.  For example Italy went from a backwater to nearly the size of Englands economy under a soft currencyhigher inflation and now back into total stagnation and decline under a hard currencyeuro.  The primary reason for high inflation in Venezuela is government killing production and hoarding foodstaples in warehouses.

1293796,20.0,0,Circle Internet Financial Ltd. one of the most heavilyfunded digital currency startups will no longer offer customers the ability to buy and sell bitcoins.  The move disclosed by the company Wednesday is the latest indication that the financial revolution that bitcoins early developers had hoped to spark isnt playing out as planned.  Bitcoin remains a closely watched virtual currency and its value is rising rapidly. But it is still a niche product often traded by speculators and investors who own it as a hedge against traditional governmentbacked currencies.   Meanwhile bitcoins underlying technology blockchain is widely being studied in the financial services industry as a possible tool to make everyday banking and complex financial processes faster and easier.  Circle backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and venturecapital firms such as Breyer Capital and General Catalyst says it will continue to use blockchain as a way to expand its fastgrowing international payments business which it hopes to integrate peertopeer money transfers into text email and other digital messages.  The companys mobile app called Circle Pay makes transfers in dollars euros and pounds. Jeremy Allaire the companys chief executive and cofounder says Circle remains committed to using blockchain to facilitate money movements between individuals and across borders. The company plans to continue using bitcoin and other digital tokens behind the scenes to settle transactions in traditional currencies.  Our vision has never been lets adopt a new currency said Mr. Allaire. He he said that bitcoin hasnt evolved quickly enough to support everyday financial activities. We want to realize overall consumer benefits without having to be a bitcoin buyingandselling exchange.  Circle says its blockchainaided payments in traditional currencies have been growing multiple times as fast as its bitcoin payments.  The story is one of essentially gridlock amongst core developers while mainstream companies are using this technology Mr. Allaire said of bitcoin. Weve been deeply frustrated with that lack of progress and we want to move it forward.  Circles announcement comes less than a week after a federal court ruled that the Internal Revenue Service could serve digitalcurrency startup Coinbase with a summons seeking detailed information on customer transactions. Coinbase which hasnt been charged with any wrongdoing said it would fight the governments sweeping request.  Circle which said it hadnt received a similar letter will partner with Coinbase for Circle customers who want to continue to buy and sell bitcoin. The price of bitcoin has risen in recent weeks with some investors using it as a hedge against inflation like gold.  This week Circle also said it plans to release free software code known as Circle Spark that can be used by digital payments providers to meet various rules including antimoneylaundering regulations when transferring money via the blockchain. Circle believes that using blockchains is cheaper and faster than traditional rails like bank transfers or card networks.  By releasing its software to the public the company hopes to spur a global network of banks and fintech firms to use the blockchain to help move money across borders and integrate payments with chatting and other digital activities. That could help Circle to emerge as a major competitor to payment apps like PayPal Holdings Incs Venmo or Zelle a soontobereleased app operated by a network of big banks. Circle is initially partnering with apps in South Korea and the Philippines.   Circle is still small relative to Venmo and the banks who are doing tens of billions of annual persontoperson mobile payments. Circle is on track for over  billion in transfers this year and it is growing quickly. Its crosscurrency transfers have grown  in the past six months.  Circles bitcoin volume meanwhile grew just  a year.,2016-12-07T14:43:02.000Z,0.25

This form of shortsightedness is endemic to a small subclass of corporations like Circle who have taken a selfdestructive antagonistic stance towards a huge group of people theyve collected into a homogeneous uncooperative bucket.  This is just demonstrative of a lack of planning a lack of simple outreach and an internal cognitive brokenness when they accept the false narratives theyve been sold. Its also the height of arrogance that they feel theyve contributed so much they can dictate and derogate the direction the original project settled onand the character of literally hundreds of people even though the reality is these companies fail in the midst of their own separate bubbles of reality that they themselves created and embraced and the group of people who otherwise manage to cooperate together have no issue opposing the terrible governance models these companies attempted to impose.

We are talking about insane growth and insane benefits from this technology even if fees go up x again next year.  After a discussion yesterday Id like to bring back the topic of counterparty risk. Because I see new people coming in Id like to inform them that leaving your money to someone else be it a bank an exchange a darknet market a borrower etc etc you face the risk of never getting your money back!  In Bitcoin there have been many hacks ponzis scams which have affected it price very negatively.  Some of the most famous ones where  Bitcoinica Mt. Gox BTCe Poloniex BitStamp Cryptsy Shapeshift Gatecoin Bitfinex BTER Vircurex Mintpal Bitpay Cavirtex Bitquick the DAO Bittrex cloud mining scams pp lending Darknet markets exit scamminggetting bust etc. The way they were hacked varied some didnt lose customer funds others refunded them others lost altcoins etc but the danger of losing everything is still there.   Coinbase has had problems with the IRS demanding customer info Cryptsy lawsuit because they helped Cryptsys CEO steal and cash out customer funds freezing accounts for gambling etc not giving customers Ethereum Classic after the Fork and so on.   Some of the old guys know about all that and prefer to stay safe. Others keep risking it. Just be the smart guy! Very few people profit from trading or arbitrage! Do you think you are in the  of people that constantly make money trading? Chances are you arent... In a year you could have made more than x just by holding your coins in a private wallet!  Some people were lending money at Bitfinex to earn interest more than  per year. Guess what happened to them... They initially lost  and then it went down to  due to BFXs clever trick. And some people just kept USD in that exchange thinking nobody could take it from them.   Dont get distracted by high yields by any altcoin like Dash Nubits Lending Club or Cloud mining scheme.  of all those are scams or just unable to keep their promises. Some people might have profited but on the expense of others and in total more people lost than gained.  And you are going to ask me What if I want to sell or buy some coins? How do I do it? Well nowadays there are many ways where you can do that safely. Might not very cheap but these are probably some of the best ways to do it   Localbitcoin Bitcoin.de Paxful Wallofcoins BitBargain Bitsquare Tether Omni Dex Mycelium local trader Purse.io itBit Gemini or  Glidera are some ways where you can buy coins with very little counterparty risk and OTC. If youd still insisted in trading BTCC and Kraken are currently the best exchanges!  The best way to buy coins would be to buy them with your debitcredit card and get them sent to your private wallet instantly! Some exchangesservices that I know are Glidera Bitstamp Coinbase Bitx Coinsbank and CEX.io. There might be others but I dont know how good they are I never buy with credit cards btw.  I once deposited coins and sold them on Kraken and within  day I had my Euros in my SEPA account. Selling coins is riskier and the only  safe way is to exchange BTC with cash with someone that you trust.  Edit  I used to sell coins via Localbitcoin a few years ago. I would buy from an exchange and sell it for more there. After some time I stopped using Localbitcoins. I had a small customer base which I trusted and they trusted me. Id work simply with bank deposits. At some point I trusted them and they trusted me so much that I would send them the coins even the day before theyd make the deposit. I never had a single problem.  But I had problems when I started... I sold coins on Localbitcoins and someone tricked me on my first trade and I released the coins. I also had a problem when I sold coins with Paypal. I was young and naive but luckily I didnt lose more than . For selling you might need to do some KYC or use services like Moneypolo OkPay and Perfect money. Avoid services where someone can reverse a transaction. These services are great for sellers but as a buyer you might lose your money if you get hacked.  It isnt just about the exchanges getting hacked. What if you get hacked? Someone could easily steal all your details and even if you had FA on they could steal your funds something extremely hard to do maybe impossible if you had a hardware wallet.  Finally arbitrage isnt that profitable. The probability of one exchange getting hacked is lower than the probability of one out of five exchange being hacked. So you have to expect losses from at least one exchange... Bitstamp BTCe and Poloniex made their customers whole again and thats very honorable but how many more blows can they take?

BU does not remove the limit instead everyone sets there own limits so the nodes converge onto one chain in a slower way.  This is a departure from the consensus algorithm Bitcoin has used for c years.  In addition to this BU creates many new devastating vulnerabilities like the median EB attack which ensures any small miner can grind the network to a halt at will.,2016-12-18T01:46:23.000Z,0.25

I dont see a single developer asking the question what would the average person want out of the bitcoin software?. I mean seriously. The bitcoin software is just shit for the average person. All it needs to be is fast cheap simple and secure. It used to at least be fast and cheap. Now its expensive slow complex and secure. So we have a secure nothing.  You could run bitcoin on  different VPS and servers well connected across the world at gtGB blocks and serve most of the western world and you could it with free transaction for the foreseeable future and you could do all this with very few changes to the code and it would only cost around  per month to run in TOTAL which for a global payment system is peanuts.  Bitcoin doesnt have a technology problem. It has a leadership problem or rather a lack of leadership problem coupled with a attack from the inside.

Would you be allowed to make that decision or would Bitmains CEO Micree overrule your decision in that case? Is it true that Micree makes decisions about hardware and you Jihan make the decisions about software? Do you both agree that changing to Bitcoin Unlimited is a software decision and therefore your decision and not Micrees decision?   I just want to know if changing to Bitcoin Unlimited is your decision or someone elses so that I dont walk around hoping for something that has  chance of happening.  Thank you for voting no for Segwit. Please keep voting no for Segwit. We big blockers would prefer Bitcoin Unlimited now and Flexible Transactions when ready. We really dislike the   Segwit signature discount that we believe is designed to make future Blockstream LN hub transactions cheaper because they use a lot of signatures per transaction and every other transaction more expensive. That discount should be  .  We dont believe that the Segwit discount would have the effect of making the UTXO set smaller.

It has slowed growth in the ecosystem and allowed for much of the world to catch up in a lot of ways.  I still think that BTC along with many of the other top cryptos are some of the best long term investments youre ever going to get in your lifetime.  The gains weve seen in the last couple of days likely have more to do with the longer term trend weve seen this past year but the economics of global assets like Bitcoin have thousands if not millions of moving parts  so its pretty well impossible to say for certain.,2016-12-22T22:26:17.000Z,0.25

The data we are broadcasting is unique i.e. cant be copied. It has value.  The hubsswitches in L layers over Bitcoin arent anything like tor nodes or prolific torrent seeders. The switches must control a lot of the unique data in order to run as efficient hubs. The more bitcoin they control the more efficient they are in the L network. That will create hubs big enough to regulate.  The fact that you think you can treat L layers over Bitcoin like network stacks shows just how little you understand about what Bitcoin is and why it is successful.   Whats more likely is you understand what Im writing fully and are trying to fool us which is just disgusting and insidious.   Either way go  off.,2016-12-06T02:10:00.000Z,0.25

1293829,15.0,0,ETH is likely to fail.  This is a given.  If it doesnt fail it could be worth x more.  So depending on how you slot in your Probabilities you can justify any price.  But it is SOOOO much more likely to succeed now than at ICO or than mos ago when it was vaporware or mos ago when the EF was running out of money or March when we had hype and not yet a single funded ETH ICO.  Now we have a more robust protocol we have battle tested dev teams that have had heaps of shit thrown at them and are still standing we have dozens of apps that are a year into development or more we have seemingly hundreds of dapps behind them so many that are in stealth mode and pop up quickly recently like Status or Etherisc and out of that maybe a handful will actually be relevant if dapps are ever a thing which is still TBD.  ETH always had a large attack surface its feature is a bug  maybe it will work out maybe it wont.  If programmable blockchains are going to be a thing in the next  years Ethereum is the only game in town.  That is the simple truth.  They have a  year headstart on everyone else Synereo being the scariest threat is now dead in the water and they have dev critical mass.  Ex ante riskreward has arguably never looked better for ETH than at  or  or wherever it is by tonight.  I participated in the ICO it was crazy ambitious then perhaps its easy to forget just how ambitious it was but ETH critics started their goalposts at scam then moved to vaporware then to project will fail on technical grounds immediately to the EF will run out of money and its a dead project to no devs are using it or take it seriously to dapps will never be a thing and are all scams to LOL bailout forks are for banksters to now the clients being out of sync for a day and that shows how crazily insecure ETH is forgetting that Bitcoin had a worse instance of this in  its th year of existence when it was much bigger in size and money at risk to whatever will be the thinner gruel that they will have to glom onto next probably price based narratives which is silly given Bitcoins drawdown history.  It had a mm valuation at ICO and many thought it was vaporware a year later.  So while in hindsight it looks like genius am I smart money? Not just the ETH ICO but I also have a ton of BTC from mining it  for  years and I never sold I just kept on keeping on and avoided panic the ETH ICO was crazy high risk ex ante.  I took that risk because I wanted to pay my BTC luck forward I thought this was the best team for an ambitious project to date and I want to better this entire space  and maybe they could actually deliver slim chance.    We could still see  or . or . because its crypto and its inefficient and illiquid and volatile.  We could also see  or  in the NTM.  But ETH has eaten a  drawdown already.  So taking this all in what do you think the smart money does?  FOMO into BTC?  Your approach is really manic.  So much so that I worry about you!  Regret minimization mental accounting overconfidence  youre living out all the most perilous investment biases in public.  You should stop trying to draw so much narrative from price action in what is an extremely volatile uncertain extremely inefficient space.  Youre going to drive yourself crazy as you flail about.

1293834,-4.0,0,I dont think anyone argues bitcoin should be a settlement system or that a fee market is an end by itself. The argument is that bitcoin should be able to function as a settlement system and able to handle a reality of full blocks correctly.  While we can argue about the optimal block size hardfork risks aside  no one really believes that it can grow big enough to handle Visalike scale. If we can agree on that we must make sure we have the tools and the experience to handle not just X or even X growth.  So while the article claims that fee market is a useless concept because block rewards will persist for at least another century  onchain capacity will hopefully! be exceeded much sooner even with a crazy size block.   Hopefully we can increase the block size  gradually and carefully as technology advances. SegWit does that and future increases can follow. But we must be ready for the day that blocks are full and a further increase is out of the question. It will be terrible if that day will be the first time wallets face fee estimation challenges and offchain solutions arent ready.,2016-12-20T13:23:33.000Z,0.25

The part that shows a gambling addiction as opposed to a desire to make money is the part where you take that bitcoin and use it as leverage for a futures position. This is your mind chasing emotional highs and lows. Thats what a lot of people dont understand about gambling addiction is that the gamblers are as addicted to the lows as they are to the highs. Both make them feel alive. If it wasnt for the potential of losing all your money in a  downward move there would be no appeal to you because it wouldnt be risky enough.  Do whatever you want but just dont try to say you are doing it because you dont want to miss out and fuck fiat. You are doing this for a gamblers rush pure and simple. Putting all your money in bitcoin is more than enough to not miss out and stick it to our fiat overlords. Taking that money and gambling on okcasino is an entirely different thing and is purely gambling addiction.

1293917,41.0,0,Point and Figure Chart  Happy New Year to everyone.  Yesterday the long pole resolved into a column of Os.  It dropped to  and had a pretty good bounce.  I thought the drop was finished but evidently China thought we needed to go back down.  So overnight we hit the  price point.  A proper correction from a long pole is half of the length of the pole.  Because the pole was  rows high the drop down could be between  and  boxes.  Thats one more box down on the drop.    Soif you are shorting we may have another  from the overnight low.  Going lower than that could be problematic for the longs.  Here is why  If there are a lot of leveraged longs coming in from the past break out at  they are going to start going into the red.  And margin calls are going to start coming in.  On top of that the traders are going to see we are not hitting the ATH on this trip and they will start to bail out.  If we go into the s the resistance drops down to the  range.  I am not sure of the Yuan price in that rangebut people trading in Yuan dont like to lose money either.  I am cautiously optimistic.  The trend is up.  We are still up based on the chartmeaning that the short term movement is up and the long term movement is up.  I think going into this weekend we wont see Dow .  The PBOC could devalue again and hit the scary  ratio of YuanDollar.  The Italian banks would go belly up.  Or nothing could happen.  The GOOD thing about bitcoin is that its a  hour market so you CAN bail on a long weekend.  So here are the new numbers  Moving up to  or more means a reversal into a column of Xs up. The Negative break down is at .  I dont think thats in play at this time. The overall trend reversal happens down at .  My guess is that it reverses above  at some point today.  But that we just bounce around waiting for something to push it from the outside.  Enjoy your long weekend and I wish us all a Happy and Healthy New Year.

Its often misrepresented here that somehow the miners would collude to do harm to the users in some way however the entire bitcoin system is designed around the game theory that the miners are incentivized to do whats in the best interest of protecting the value that they have mined.,2016-12-11T15:15:51.000Z,0.25

1293927,36.0,0,First of all note that Bitcoin Unlimited doesnt do anything to the consensus rules by itself. It instead lets the user set the blocksize settings. The user is free to set them to match Bitcoin Core settings in which case there is no difference from now. All BU does is make it easier for the user to change the settings without having to know how to code.   Thus BU is not fundamentally a bigger blocks implementation. Its a user control implementation. It simply recognizes that when Bitcoin is at trilliondollar market caps it will make no freaking sense to have consensus rules be tied to easily cooptable centralized development teams as all dev teams are. Instead coordination on consensus rules will have to happen in a decentralized fashion where each economically important node and miner makes an informed decision rather than trusting Papa Core.  If people think this will lead to bigger blocks it can only be because the ecosystem of economically important nodes and miners want bigger blocks and believe there is no danger of centralization. You can thus see that Cores position is innately paternalistic thinking that the devs know best about how to design incentives and economic constraints. Realize that not a single one of the devs at Bitcoin Core nor to be fair any other team have demonstrated any expertise in incentive or economic design except Satoshi who is now gone.,2016-12-28T19:55:43.000Z,0.25

Any proof against or mockery of your theory can be waved away and in fact is even further proof that you must be getting closer to the truth.  gtThis is good for Bitcoin!  I like reading about conspiracy theories and think a lot of shady things have happened in the past but any internet community relating to conspiracy theories is populated  by insane people because theyve seemingly driven out everyone else.   Theres no point in discussing or arguing with these people. The standards for proof that supports their theory are nonexistent and the standards for proof that disproves their theory are impossible to match. Many of them seem to believe basically every theory that gains popularity on the internet which is probably why see we said they were spying on us! turns into that also inherently means that our theory about Hillary being involved in a satantic child sex slavery ring based in the hidden basement of a D.C family pizza joint is  fact! Theres almost nobody that believes that Sandy Hook was a false flag but  was not an inside job from what Ive seen. You have to start getting into lizard people territory before some of these people go come on thats ridiculous.  Spend some time in these communities. These people arent interested in the truth. Theyre interested in identifying the official story or commonly accepted truth and then believing the exact opposite of that. Its a very easy way to make yourself feel like youre smarter than everyone else.   gtIts like Im really living in my dystopian cyberpunk corporatocracy just like in my favorite video games! We the internet need to fight the corporations using our foolproof investigative powers to expose the New World Order! Its such a shame that my group of people is so small and elite because were the only ones smart and perceptive enough to see the world as it truly is.  The reality is that there is a lot to be suspicious and concerned about when it comes to large corporations and our government but they dont actually care about making the world a better place. The fact that they turn every single last thing into a conspiracy theory and the fact that theyre so plainly stupid about most of it just stigmatizes skepticism and probably makes it even harder for anyone to effectively criticize things that deserve to be criticized.

1293938,79.0,0,Bitcoin is an innovation that solves an important longstanding computer science problem. It   permits an individual to transfer units on a public ledger  prohibits anyone else from transferring those units  This is what gives bitcoin its value.  It sounds like and easy problem to solve but it is not. Think about trying to design an email system where the text can be sent only once  how could you possibly control for that? Thats sort of what the mining network does for bitcoin using the blockchain  makes sure the same units are transacted by their owner only once.  I think sometimes people see bitcoin as a scheme or a fad  but I suspect those people havent taken an honest look into what problem it solves. I get it. It smells funny like Work from home for  a month but bear with me a bit and let me explain why its such a very thoughtful solution to this difficult problem.  The blockchain is   immutable  it cannot be rewritten  past transactions are final  public ledger  all transactions can be viewed and verified by everyone  public source  the software which the miners run is open source  decentralized  there is no central authority which can change the rules or the transactions  distributed  the validation effort is spread throughout the world  trustless  there is no need for trust in any party  its just math see useweso comment below  permissionless  anyone can participate without an account or public identity  peertopeer  this is sort of implied be the collection above but worth noting  These are all desirable traits of a global ledger at least from a technological standpoint. The blockchain units bitcoin are   fungible  units cannot be individually blacklisted or devalued  easily transmittable  one click  frictionless  cost to transmit any amount is negligible see useweso comment below  permanently storable  units can be kept safe indefinitely with no overhead  programmable  this one is really wild  transactions can occur with no humans involved based on an preprogrammed set of rules there are SO many applications here  All desirable traits of a global ledger units at least from a technological standpoint  Lots of additional innovations have already been built right into bitcoin like multisignature transaction,2016-12-24T13:25:31.000Z,0.25

They are proprietary and support updates which essentially give the CPU full control of your machine.  The prices today are out of reach for most people.

No other hardware that Im aware of is both libre and capable of competing in terms of performance.  If it is important to you that a single corporation not be able to control your entire computer you should be funding Talos or another libre CPU project like Talos.

1293983,26.0,0,Slide  Addresses do not have balances nor hold bitcoins. They can be longer and are often full URIs.  addresses do not define nor indicate any specific format or key count.  Slide  Key pair refers to both the pubkey and privkey together and no longer makes a whole lot of sense in light of HD wallets which have a single private keyseed for all pubkeys. The signature proves control not ownership rather than the pubkey.  Slide  Needs a new definition of hashhashing this one is useless. Broadcasted transactions are not in any block or the blockchain until they are mined. Typo confirmation. Probably should elaborate on the necessity of  blocks for confirmation.  Slide  Nodes in general dont necessarily participate in the broadcasting beyond receiving the broadcast of block headers not individual transactions or even full blocks. Full nodes also dont need any of those things except that they must have downloaded and verified all the blocks at some point in time but may have pruneddiscarded them since. Typo light nodes. Light nodes dont perform full validation and may not have ever downloaded the full blockchain. SPV nodes are light nodes which also understand socalled fraud proofs generated by full nodes to warn them of invalid blocks these do not currently exist.  Slide  The block reward includes the fees from the block. The term you want here for the amount minus fees is block subsidy. Mining cannot be collaborated on what mining pools actually do is establish a formal agreement to share the reward when participating miners find a block.  Slide  Protocol in Bitcoin protocol is not capitalised. Powers is the wrong term here I think bitcoins are the subject of the blockchain but they dont really power it. Fees are not necessarily tied to the transaction size just typically when segwit activates they probably wont be anymore.  Slide  This is  The letter mu is often ... missing something? I dont understand the quick transition from mBTC units to protocols and algorithms...  Slide  Bitcoin transactions are not strictly irreversible only grow harder to reverse the more blocks are mined on top of them. Notably unconfirmed transactions are not difficult to reverse at all. Transactions should only be considered likelyirreversible after  or more blocks.  Slide  Bitcoin is today not censorshipresistant due to mining centralisation. The blockchain does not preserve data and while transactions can hypothetically commit to data there is yet no sane standard for doing so today. In no case are these useful for proofofownership and only to a very limited extent for proofoforiginality.  Slide  Claims too much. Bitcoin just doesnt allow noninteractive seizure. Your government can still force you to hand over funds andor punish you for violating sanctions. Bitcoin shouldnt be promoted as a means to violate the law as if the law cannot be enforced through nonautomated means. Centralised systems primary costs are regulatory whereas decentralised systems have an inherently higher technical cost in redundant verification. It is still to be determined which cost is overall higher and there is no reason to assume Bitcoin will remain the cheapest option.  Slide  The blockchain is designed to provide privacy and as such doesnt expose abuse.  Slide  Have the roots in the Cypherpunk beliefs claims and details of those beliefs been verified? I dont know if it is true or not.  Slide  Bandwidth requirements shouldnt be overlooked. With  MB blocks each location with Bitcoin access needs at a minimum a constant kbps . GBmo  or with segwit kbps . GBmo. To start a new node however several magnitudes more is required to download the full blockchain history. It is not possible to use Bitcoin though SMS only to remotely ask a trusted third party using other trusted thirdparties as middlemen to do things on your behalf.  Slide  The network has been down for maintenance at least a few times due to technical problems.  Slide  Nobody knows how much Satoshi did or didnt mine.  Slide  It should probably be noted that  attacks can be performed with much less than over  of the network just with diminishing rates of success.  Slide  In addition to conspiracy it is also possible that mining pools and miners could be compromised by the same attacker. Since mining all uses unencrypted connections BGP hijacking can even take over a substantial part probably a majority of the network without even compromising anyones computers.  Slide  Developers decisions have no influences on the network. It is the users who choose to run the modified code who have that influence. Users also have influence since they enforce the protocol rules rejecting blocks miners might make that do not follow those rules.  Slide  Contains FUD against theymos. His forums while perhaps overly controlled by a single person are not censored and he a strong advocate against censorship. For this reason BitcoinTalk became too noisy with trolling and thus lost usefulness and is not recommended. However rBitcoin has had more reasonable moderation and is still a decent place to discuss Bitcoin although never has been used as a technical forum.  Slide  Nobody knows how many bitcoins Satoshi mined.,2016-12-30T22:55:19.000Z,0.25

1293996,20.0,0,gtI agree that this seems troubling at least short term but Bitcoin simply has too much support and love by people for it to die out or be ruined by stagnation and lack of development  fixing the scaling issue.  Tell that to myspace and friendster. The reality is that network effect needs momentum IOW it needs room to grow and be more and more accessible and useful to users. Imagine if the telephone system had been crippled so that only  people could use it at any one time? Or if you could only talk for  mins each day? Or if as more users were added to the system it cost more and more to make a phone call. Saying network effect will keep it in the lead is a poor argument as things almost never turn out like that unless you have been able to create an artificial monopoly. Bitcoin has the exact opposite of a monopoly on blockchain based networks and if they dont find a way to grow in a sustainable manner other blockchains will outmanoeuvre and outgrow them given enough time.  Scaling aside given that governments are relying more and more on blockchain analysis as well as tracking users spending via the blockchain you will find more and more people wanting privacy due to the risk in receiving coins from possibly illegal sources as well as having to jump through hoops to prove your coins are legitimately acquired. Ive already been on the pointy end of this and this will only increase. This is a burden for merchants and users and Monero relieves both of that burden to police themselves so its not necessarily a desire for privacy but a desire to not be forced to police or self censor themselves. Monero fits the bill for this and makes it impossible for governments to dig deeper than the user or merchants own spendingreceiving history. Coupled with the fact that it has a flexible blocksixe as well as other sensible mechanisms I think Monero is set to become a serious competitor network effect and price isnt going to stop that from happening. While Bitcoin spins its wheels Monero is only going to gain ground.,2016-12-29T16:35:58.000Z,0.25

1294005,18.0,0,They dont do it all the time.   But yes it is clear that Bitcoin actually has more capacity but the current protocol is skewed a bit towards mining empty blocks unless they are very full and rich with fees.   Which means that increasing block size rapidly could kill the market.   The fact that  of the network is currently signalling BU .... pushing for larger blocks with lower fees will make it even more glaring.     There is a nice incentive for large miners game the system massively increase block size  all the while mining empty blocks  or mining these new massive full blocks.   If BU is released I would expect big miners to increase max block size to MB  and then result in a more glarinb pattern of emptyoverfull blocks.   Smaller pools running standard software will suffer and fail and overall network health will also fall apart.  Thats why Core is so crazy about preventing centralization  its very very important.   Block size should never be in the hands of miners  who have a financial interest in gaming the system.,2016-12-15T19:21:41.000Z,0.25

1294012,39.0,0,Or for anyone interested in the slightlymoresophisticatedthanthememe version of this idea  Probably the most persistent and universal thing giving bitcoin the token value is the utility of its inbuilt payment network and the pseudonymity and censorship resistance qualities which come along with it...that utility is inseparably connected to each unit token as a share of that. There are plenty of other more ethereal reasons for people to value it all of which backs the bitcoin currency in the same fundamental way which the requirement of paying taxes in dollars backs that money.  The creation or evolution of money on a market vs. by government fiat to promote or sustain its existence faces a coordination problem in getting to that point of ubiquity and liquidity such that its primary usevalue is in fact use as the most saleable token of indirect exchange I.e. that is when something becomes money...which by the way bitcoin is does not actually serve yet as money in any significant economic sphere and that point that Morpheus is talking about is essentially when bitcoin becomes a unitofaccount money.  Markets are slow to create money in the face of this market failurecoordination problem. Thus market monies of the past have often been commodities which had some significant nonmonetary usevalue prior to becoming money which naturally put them in to the hands of many people e.g. golds use for jewelry and bootstrapped those commodities to the point that their good monetary properties fungibility divisibility scarcity etc could manifest and ensconce the commodity in place as the most saleable commodity such that it is mostly useful for indirect exchange itself rather than the nonmonetary utility. There is even an argument to be made that a money is ideally free from the demand and supply shocks which come from the other uses of the commodity. In this way and because of its superior monetary properties bitcoin excels beyond gold and other commodity monies of the past.  But what is not well understood and appreciated even among bitcoin enthusiasts is that bitcoin is not yet money...that it is still in a phase of price discovery and trying as it were to overcome the catch  coordination problems which are arguably more present with a token like bitcoin...which has less of an obvious nonmonetary value or usecomponent with which to bootstrap itself into widespread holding in the first place such that its monetary properties can manifest in closed transaction loops as a token suddenly valuable for itself its use in indirect exchange.  This is where the hype and the booms and crash cycles of its price and the speculation and FOMO come in to play these are market mechanisms whereby we in both an emergent and unconscious...but also a conscious and entrepreneurial fashion are willing and artificially promoting bitcoin into position as the most saleable commodity. We are using the prospect of massive gains to coordinate merchants along with their vendors and customers to simultaneously have an individually rational reason to adopt bitcoin even though firms arent normally in the good habit of getting into foreign currency speculation at the expense of their regular business...we are making the profit opportunities too high for these players or most anyone to ignore thus they all start demanding the token for itself rather than as a proxy for the real money that they ultimately want to exchange it for right now.,2016-12-29T02:58:02.000Z,0.0

1294015,18.0,0,Sure I can answer those questions. It is suited for low use applications. We often comically refer to it as a computer no more powerful than a smartphone from the s. But thats not where its power lies. By harnessing blockchain technology this essentially becomes a computer that every nodeuser actually doesverifies the same computations therefore ensuring that its tamperproof. An analog for Bitcoin is that by every node confirming that a transactionpayment has been made no one can lie about it. Things like Dota are extremely complex computationally and in no reality does it makes sense to have every node running it.  But there are many other use cases. Lets try to go through one that could be relevant for Wikileaks. For one once documents or files are uploaded to the Swarm protocol a layer that sits on top of the Ethereum tech it sits there....forever. Theres no way to delete it doctor it censor it and so forth. The file is essentially chopped up into tiny bits encrypted and stored all over the world. Taking it down is the same as trying to take down every single node simultaneously. What would happen if Twitter decided to remove everything one day or would be so ordered to by court mandate? Poof one day its gone.  Another example is Reddit or social media or Twitter censorship. Im sure everyone heard about the reddit admin fiasco a few days ago. There are people working on social media platforms that are censorshipproof. Meaning the source code and architecture of what isisnt possible is open source and if youre going to be a part of this platform everyone knows ahead of time that it is impossible to censor discussion unlike reddit admin censorship which Im sure came as quite a surprise to many.  Swarm also allows decentralized web hosting. Meaning websites will no longer be hosted on servers subject to the whims of ISPs or governments to shut down. Register www.wikileaks.eth and that webpage will actually be hosted in bits and chunks across nodes everywhere as long as you could continue to access the PP Ethereum network...Im not technical enough to know if thats blockable or not....but its akin to blocking people from being able to use torrent services  Essentially the ambition is to create censorshipproof and private money data communications identities asset management and so forth.  Is it finished? No. Is it perfect? Nope. Has it had growing pains? Absolutely. But there are hundreds of developers working on this platform and each day it gets a little bit closer to fruition. Check out rethereum for more info.  Also this isnt just the main developers working on the protocol. Independent developers can create censorshipproof apps on Ethereum. Check out dapps.ethercasts.com for some dapps but the sexy ones these days are Golem Augur Gnosis Digix Status and Maker.,2016-12-16T01:28:14.000Z,0.25
1294016,14.0,0,TLDR   There is low confidence in the platform because it is not delivering on its promises. The base dapps Dapp store contract registry reputation system i.e. the basic building blocks of Web Three are missing.    There is no network effect there are too few nodes and this makes Ethereum fragile.    Bitcoins only application is to be an alternative to fiat currency which I find is too much of a generalisation and unfair to all the developers building Bitcoinbased appschains while Ethereums value proposition is completely different which I agree  but this is not why ETH is  while BTC is    Personally I agree with points  and  but would add theDAO hack and the DOS attack during Devcon together with the unintentional fork between Geth and Parity have undermined confidence in Ethereum. My guess is theDAO hack cost  with the DOS attack another  giving. Without these wed be around  which is fair for an asyet unproven yet incredibly promising platform.,2016-12-27T20:17:34.000Z,0.25

1294048,-9.0,0,Its the opposite pal. Poor people suffer more as DEBTS become more difficult to service. Compound interest is what creates poverty.  Private debt owners want their money to multiple by itself via compound interest while ignoring the GRIND it places on those who are forced to pay the interest. They want a hard currency because it protects their idle wealth. Bondholders want to be repaid in dollars that are worth more so they favor artificial constraints against the economy to prevent overheating and all sorts of pseudoeconomics. Code words for restricting money. These are the theories that underpin bitcoin.  The bitcoin ecosystem is a microcosm of what an economy under bitcoin would look like. No investment mass poverty misery while the new oligarchsVer Voorhees etc invest into casinos and drug dealing. No spending would occur because people would have a decreasing share of money. Just use bitcoin community as an example everyone fucking each other over with scams.  My interpretation isnt hilarious Italy had a soft currencyLira which kept spending high in the economy and fueled investment and growth. This led to an unprecedented scenario where Italy surpassed England despite England having a substantial head start under every conceivable economic metric. Anglosaxon economics have always been focused on fiscal conservatism and sound money lending at interest etc. AngloSaxon economics is focused on existing capital while completely ignoring where wealth comes fromhuman labor. This nonesense was imported into the Eurozone.

By the way vicious put downs and derision of anyone with an alternate view is not listening.  Doing exactly what you plan to do without any changes is not a compromise.

That leads to fascism Bitcoin is what Bitcoin is you can do what you want limiting someones freedom and judging them for it is antithetical to the freedom weve been given by accepting Bitcoin. There is not controlling people here. This is not fascism this is anarchy. I truly apologize if you are not used to it. I was not but my kin comes from the projects so this chaos is in our blood with a lot more violence tho.  gtWhat we really need is a new leader or system to replace CoreBlockStreamTheymos that everyone can agree on even if it means compromising on peoples vision of bitcoins evolution.  Bitcoin is supposed to be leaderless. Satoshi bailed on this project and left it leaderless. Although Gavin maintained the mainnet code he was never a leader and never wanted to be and if you talk with him I still dont think he wants to be a political leader. Thus Bitcoin needs to survive in a leaderless situation.   If someone with no name presents a solution and everyone agrees is that solution not wise?  None of us have the authority to decide where Bitcoin goes and anyone who says otherwise is unwise. Just as the Oracle of Delphi said Socrates is the wisest man in Greece. While he searched for someone wiser as he said I know nothing he eventually realized what the Oracle had said. He was the only one aware of his own ignorance. Know thyself.

The prisoners according to Plato would infer from the returning mans blindness that the journey out of the cave had harmed him and that they should not undertake a similar journey. Socrates concludes that the prisoners if they were able would therefore reach out and kill anyone who attempted to drag them out of the cave a.  Bitcoin is trying to free your mind from generations of being stuck in a cave. Of being a mentally dead slave. Perhaps you are just experiencing stress as someone who has been freed is trying to remove you from the cave.

1294082,19.0,0,XMR is referred to as an altcoin largely by the incumbent crypto community i.e. Bitcoiners and day traders utilizing the semantics of the markets.  Here in our own community we are well aware that Monero is built upon a completely different codebase that offers a vastly different set of features some would say that these features reflect what BTC attempted to implement from Bitcoin.  Thus change begins with us As we continue to assert ourselves as a completely separate entity by gaining traction through exposure XMR will stand more and more on its own.  Even issues such as Jaxx and Exodus implementation of Monero into their respective wallet services show that this is not some shitclone copy of the BTC codebase Ill spare examples but we all know to whom Im referring and that in order to make use of XMR requires a restructuring of the preexisting ecosystem.  Bitfinexs decision to implement an XMRUSD pair today was a leap of faith on their part but one that will pay off in the end for them because they were the ones brave enough to try something new something that many of us here understand actually implements the concept of anonymous ecash. The approach of the GUI release along with a point release prior to the next preRingCT hardfork are nice but its important to keep the big picture in mind In ways big or small those here that actually make an effort to contribute to the Monero ecosystem are assisting in the construction of an anonymous currency system upon which lives could depend in the future.

Thats why satoshi added the Mb limit in secret to make sure this exploit not get known before the fix was active. The fear of such an attack is now long gone. As mining is now a very costly affair and Mb blocks pose no big threat to Bitcoin. thanks to hardware improvements and thanks to efforts from Core devs to optimise Bitcoin in various ways. Satoshi was very clear in his vision for Bitcoin and that nodes would move towards datacenters. He was sure that the limit could be easily lifted. Therefor if we stayed true to Bitcoinssatoshis original vision we would certainly have more onchain scaling than we have now.   But since Satoshi is gone things changed. Mining and running a node are now separate tasks. The former gets paid the latter doesnt. Most mining is now performed in China. And the version of SPV clients isnt as secure as Satoshi envisioned it. All these changes and new insights shifted opinions away from Satoshis vision and which ultimately led us to where we are now.   At some point this video happened,2016-12-24T19:57:27.000Z,0.25

When was bitcoin good for micro transactions? Are there any current use cases which depend on bitcoin micro transactions? Even if fees were  penny that makes micro transactions impractical.  fee on a  purchase doesnt make much sense at a high frequency.   Do you recall all of  and  when merchant adoption peaked and bitcoin fees were low simultaneously? Do you recall all those businesses discontinuing acceptance of bitcoin because they realized how impractical it was when fiat already solved that use case so well?  Do you think that bitcoin has its current crypto market share and market price because of micro transactions?   I dont think so. Bitcoin has its current market share and price because it has proven to be a reliable store of value that is also decentralized and borderless. It also has many current use cases for which it is clearly the most practical solution gambling darknet ransomware capital flight and speculation. Those actual current use cases also contribute to its evaluation. Expectation of bitcoins ability to be suitable for micro payments might also be a part of the current market valuation but I believe itms a very tiny one.  Sometimes I think some people in this community really just cant accept or admit what the current practical applications of bitcoin are and what currently gives bitcoin its value.

1294118,23.0,0,ValueShuffle is pretty awesome.  Section  on related work does a great job of explaining its relation to the other efforts in the space.  It looks highly complementary and will make mix partners easier to find since the values involved dont need a common denominator.  We will still need TumbleBits efforts until CT activates and makes this possible.  CoinJoin is currently more deployed than TumbleBit but it has a nagging problem with information asymmetry between makers and takers i.e. it leaks and TumbleBits deployment readiness is fast changing.  One important aspect of CT and a benefit to building upon it with this direction of work is that everything is compatible with pruning.  This is good for a sustainable full node population!    The technical difference of decent pruning will result in Bitcoin destroying Monero in the long run.  It does mean however that the conversation about when we are ready to activate CT will get noisy as theres currently well over M in Monero that will be fighting bagholding obsolescence.    Zcash is also not prunable so this will help Bitcoin crush that schism as well at the price of yet more bagholderinvestor noise in the CT activation discussion.  Theres a lot to chew on here and its too early for me to be confident that there wont be other leaks of information while looking for mix partners like is happening in CoinJoin right now but Im optimistic.,2016-12-27T04:08:20.000Z,0.25

1294145,30.0,0,Look at the bigger picture here. Bitcoin is only valuable because of the prospect that it will be a widely used digital cash. Digital cash however will not be a currency without default privacy and fungibility. Now either Bitcoin is able to change its qualities to better resemble what a digital cash needs to be to function or something else that meets the requirements of a digital cash will take its place. Maybe Bitcoin finds a realworld use better suited to its inherent transparent nature or maybe it continues to trip up on itself and further slingshot itself into the void of uselessness. Furthermore people seem to lose sight of just how long cryptocurrency adoption will take till it is widely used and accepted. In this period of time many cryptocurrencies will pass and go. Only the cryptocurrencies with strong community development and real world usecase will live on and I can barely count on one hand the number of coins that meet those requirements.   So to answer your question I believe Bitcoin will likely still exist in some form in the future even if hardly recognizable and Monero will also still exist because right now it is the only coin that meets the requirements of a digital cash and there will be a large need for those qualities in our ever spiralling society to protect our basic liberties.,2016-12-02T14:27:01.000Z,0.25

No I dont have a good solution for this.

1294151,-4.0,1,The money of the internet is currently best suited for internet use cases which require circumventing regulations and capital controls darknets gambling speculation ransomware. Lets just keep in mind what bitcoin is currently good for and has been good for and lets separate that from what some of us hope bitcoin will be good for buying a coffee. Lets also keep in mind that buying a  order from a bakery and buying coffee from a Starbucks are both things that anyone can already do easily without bitcoin. There is no problem there for bitcoin to solve. Bitcoin has never been a practical solution to such use cases.  Now thats not saying I dont share the same hope that bitcoin becomes good for such things one day but lets not get ahead of ourselves. Solutions to scaling and making such brick and mortar shop payments more effective are on the horizon with Segwit and LN.   Even if we increased block size and the fees dropped down as a result you would still be asking such brick and mortar shops to accept  confirmation payments.   I think the real path to realizing a practical way to spend bitcoins on coffeebread is through payment channels with such merchants. I dont think that putting such transactions on chain will ever make practical sense no matter how much it suits the libertarianbitcoin ideology.,2016-12-14T16:52:04.000Z,0.25
1294152,16.0,0,Gave it a toss no hit yet. Heres what I do know   In June  the largest block to date was mined at nearly kb .   July  saw the implementation of the maxblocksize option soft limit presumably in response to the spammy block full of SatoshiDice payouts.   Block sizes continue to grow approaching K throughout . No MB block had been mined.   In March  block  is mined including the monstrous kb transaction eedbaffdbeecddeacaba  this is the first block to exceed kb let us call that a full block. Obviously in order to mine this transaction and claim its  BTC fee a miner would have to either mine it to the exclusivity of other transactions or produce a full block. This miner chose the latter.   Still looking for the next full block to follow dont really have great tools for the job.  Dec  is a promising date as it sees a spike in average transaction volume and block size but I havent dug into the individual blocks of the day gotta do other things IRL calls..  quick edit I did what I came to do which was debunk this claim  gt MB blocks showed up pretty much immediately when Bitcoin Core made the soft limit configurable.     nullc  Setting aside that Bitcoin Core didnt exist back then it was bitcoinqt the soft limit was configurable as early as July of  and the first block to exceed kb wasnt mined until March   months later.

All of your arguments completely ignore this and make some mystical hand waving assumption that Bitcoin just is digital gold. No Bitcoin became valueable because people speculated that it had the utility to replace other forms of currency for peer to peer transactions and that there wasnt much anyone could do to stop it.  Your arguments are like judging the value of a cart of groceries by the square centimeters of air the groceries occupy while ignoring if the cart is full of Almas cavier or rotten apples.

1294185,15.0,0,Well as another fellow developer its kind of a silly statement to hear that its meant to be hidden. I mean theres multiple libraries that provide the API to quite trivially parse the GB of all on the BitCoin BlockChain. You know as much as I do its a mere few lines of code for extracting most of what matters.  My personal theory is that a DMS release would be very easy and obvious. There are no good reasons to obfuscate it. You want the content released. Especially since the BlockChain is censorproof theres hardly a good incentive for it to be obscure. I literally expect it to be in plain text and if theres complex encoding due to large file then the instructions will be provided in clear txt how to cobble up the parts together.  As far as DMS goes though if I were to make one Id probably make it using RAID pattern this way allowing for the signal to be reconstructable even if some DMS do not triggergets disabled. This has the side benefit of providing tripwires so to speak to avoid an accidental release and advance warning that things are amiss.,2016-12-08T07:04:50.000Z,0.25

You are advocating a change from that in order to intentionally in a planned way keep fees artificially low. That is nonsense.  EDIT  gtSatoshi The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free  Hijacking Bitcoin development is not easy as is demonstrated by XT Classic BU and whatever else comes next. People choose to run Bitcoin Core. Most people. Almost every business. The developers for Core collectively choose not to do something they see as incredibly stupid in their software and most people agree with them by continuing to run it.   As for developers with relatively smaller contributions they are meek and easy to manipulate? You are fucking psychotic seweso. Those people choose to contribute their time and efforts to that software. Why wouldnt they just go work on an alternative client if they disagreed with what Core was doing?

I would especially like to thank a few people on here who told me a few months ago to stop posting analysis without having skin in the game. I listened and I owe it to you guys.  I am invested in bitcoin longterm so I will continue to monitor the price although not as much as I have in the past maybe force myself to only look max  times per day.  To my haters I am not upset the stats are that  of you will lose money I knew this so it hasnt bothered me. If I had been upvoted each day maybe I wouldnt have made successful trades. So regardless of the process I am happy with the outcome.   I think that maybe this forum should experiment with say a week of no option to downvote posts it might encourage more open discussions for differing points of view. Many people get chased away the way things currently stand since not many people want to deal with a barrage of downvoteshate each day even if they are making the winning trades.

It is a store of value but not even the perfect one. The crypto market is like a children right now. As it appears with recents news banks experiments conferences.. crypto will be a major change of the next  years and bitcoin is not the currency that the wide public can use for obvious technical reasons scalibity performance utility  What about alts ? Monero is like bitcoin but i dont think the public values privacy THAT MUCH. The major goals are scalabity performance and stability. The major part of alts are failures or future ones. Ethereum is not able to provide any a these YET. But the way their improve and forsee the future is the best ive ever seen in crypto and if they manage to reach their objective i believe ETH could be the major crypto along BTC. This is not stupid hype this is realism OF COURSE it could fail but Vitalik and his team are the most promising organisation in crypto.

1294209,26.0,0,what bugs has luke introduced to bitcoin that took x number of developer hours to comb through and fix?  Seems much more likely you just found an article that someone wrote about a negative experience they had with a bad developer and thought to yourself what developer do i not like? and then somehow merged the article with luke.  I imagine this is related to  of a couple of things things. Either his religious beliefs which have nothing to do with bitcoin and shouldnt be relevant to any discussion here or the fact that he supports the idea of smaller blocks. Well first of all if a case can be made for no block limit a case can be made for a moderate block size increase and a case can be made for keeping the blocksize the same why is it heresy to make a case that the blocks should be smaller?  His priorities are about making bitcoin as resource inexpensive as possible such that someone can be a full node even under harsh circumstances bad network weak hardware. These are all valid arguments and while you might not agree with his priorities which is fine attacking and mocking him for it is quite fucking childish.

1294218,16.0,0,Small blocker is a misnomer. All socalled smallblockers support SegWit which is a max block size increase. Many also support an eventual hardfork max block size increase. The better term is decentralist.  A larger max block size would have many advantages   Itd be much more expensive to disrupt the network by spamming transactions and the continuum of fees would become more smooth. Thisd reduce but not eliminate the instances of stuck transactions. Though the real solution to stuck transactions is fee bumping by wallets.  Transaction fees would go down which would make Bitcoin more usefulattractive. I personally am not worried about how this would impact total mining rewards since the subsidy is very high it will remain high for at least  years and I suspect that in the far future miners can be funded by assurance contracts andor other alternatives.  The max block size is a form of decentral economic planning which is distasteful for many reasons. Though I believe that for Bitcoin to have any security at all some fullnodeenforced limit maybe not a single global limit is just as necessary as the  million BTC cap which is equally a form of economic planning.  In the first few years of Bitcoin using Bitcoin was extremely convenient. You could take anyones address and send them nearly any amount of BTC immediately usually with zero fee and your transaction would almost always get confirmed in the next block. It felt like the Bitcoin block chain was a limitless ocean of capacity. This was really nice. Unfortunately this was only possible because Bitcoin was absolutely tiny then and it will never happen again onchain even if blocks became unlimited. A very similar feeling might eventually be possible with Lightning and welldesigned Lightningsupporting wallets.  It is a reasonable thought to argue that itd be good for Bitcoin to grow very quickly so that it becomes so entrenched in society that fighting it becomes difficult. But anything that causes such superfast growth would probably weaken Bitcoins security so much that governments could easily coopt it. Even today the Chinese government could via miners totally shut down Bitcoin overnight the only defense against this is a strong fullnode economy credibly able to threaten a PoW change. Satoshi thought that each governments desire to control the worlds currency might eventually lead to a stalematecompromise in which theyd agree to leave it decentralized but IMO its more likely their compromise would be to create some abomination. Its better to take as much time as is needed to make Bitcoin so secure and decentralized on a technical level maybe even more than Satoshi thought possible that it is beyond attack from any adversary.,2016-12-03T18:20:21.000Z,0.25

1294250,49.0,0,My rebuttal rebuttal  gt in  years the block reward is down to less than a bitcoin per reward.  years is MUCH smaller than  years  And that same Bitcoin would be very valuable if Bitcoin was able to grow in that same timespan. Replacing the current mining reward with tx fees is also weird btw because who knows that level of security we need. The fact that we pay  per day to secure bitcoin does not mean we actually need it.   The weird thing is that the same people who want the blocksize limit also claim that  Bitcoin can reach millions and take over the dollar. That kinda needs bitcoin to grow in price. Does a factor  every four years sound ok to you?   gt there would always be a fee market  Pretty sure John also says the same thing. The thing we are fighting is an artificial fee market. Pushed by censorship and attacks by the likes of you.   A fee of zero can be the result of a fee market.   gt Having a myriad of pools does not equate to having a myriad of independent mining hardware operators.  And a mining operator would be smart to not even let himself control the hashing power. As that would be highly unprofessional and very risky. His investors or his own wallet depend on a miner not to be that stupid.   You falsely believe that Bitcoin is secured by decentralised mining. I assure you it is not.   Miners being centralised is entirely selfreported. You could be nonethewiser if they choose to hide their identities.   No. In reality Bitcoin is secure because of incentives.

1294261,23.0,0,Some of the changes in v of Winklevoss S described below. Overall not that extensive which could suggest last set of comments from the SEC was not that significant.  . Bitcoin now defined not as a digital asset but a commodity with a footnote to a legal case referencing Bitcoin is a commodity as defined in Section a of the Commodity Exchange Act.  U.S.C.  a. See In re Coinflip Inc. No.  CFTC Sept.   Coinflip.  This could help support the listing as there are many commodity ETFs.  .  Additional references to the new Gemini daily auctions as potentially promoting price stability this was already covered elsewhere in v so not totally new. And financial statements now note the auction prices will be used for current value calculations.  .  Added reference to CFTC settling with Bitfinex and some other cases to a section discussing SEC  other regulator actions. The argument is that these actions tend to support similarity of bitcoin to other commodities  securities.  .  Added risk factor on split gt  In the event of a permanent fork with two separate and incompatible Bitcoin Networks the Trust Gemini Exchange and the Custodian will elect to support the Bitcoin Network with the greatest cumulative computational difficulty in order to engage in bitcoin transactions and the valuation of bitcoin. The greatest cumulative computational difficulty is defined as the total threshold number of hash attempts required to mine all existing blocks in the respective Blockchain accounting for potential differences in relative hash difficulty. If interest in the selected Bitcoin Network diminishes this could adversely affect the value of the Trusts bitcoin and the value of an investment in the Shares.  .  Updated discussion of Gemini exchange compared to other exchanges in terms of volume prices. Argument seems to be supporting COINs reliance on a US regulated exchange that reflects global bitcoin prices.  .  Adds reference to Sept.  US treasury notice As the Use of Virtual Currencies in Taxable Transactions Becomes More Common Additional Actions are Needed to Ensure Taxpayer Compliance and notes IRS may revisit tax treatment accordingly.  .  Includes template for additional financial information that would be reported but all blank numbers and some additional notes to financial statements including treatment of bitcoin as a commodity for financial statement purposes and use of auction price for current value.,2016-12-07T19:20:16.000Z,0.25

The first range of blocks suggested to check were from  to  but these blocks were created daysweeks before the October disconnection of JAs internet.  There were large spikes in WL Bitcoin transaction activity  days and  days after his internet was disconnected.  Guess how many complete and usable AESCBC decryption keys have been found in all of October November and now Decembers transactions?  Hint The value is pretty much zero.  Oh so you say the Japanese team and the South Korean team have already found some of the keys?  Dont you think wed have heard at least SOMETHING about this ANYWHERE else besides the chans?

As far as XKeyscore automagically and instantly terminating your internet access call me a SERIOUS skeptic.  Heres what I suggest.  Anybody having any sort of clue what the keys might be or what parts of their values are put them in a text file and display that on your screen then take a picture of it and remove every last bit of EXIF data from the pictureimage file.  IrfanView is a good image viewer for checking this.

India is going through a full hard ban on cash the West is slowly trying to ban cash by getting rid of large bills under the guise that large bills are for criminals. Then you will have to have your money in bank accounts and deal with the negative rates going on in Europe and Japan. America will try to raise rates and have to go negative once everyone else has their sinking ships abandoned then lock all the capital here.

1294282,56.0,0,I appreciate the emphasis on TA in this sub and in many ways it works well with crypto quite often.  I do disagree with the idea that TA is the only way to determine the ultimate price direction of an investment vehicle.  The wait for a break of xyz with xyz volume approach is preached a lot in here and I understand it but hate to see people get wrecked because of it.    I mean clearly with bitcoin you see several examples of flash dumps right after those lines appear to be broken.  This last one was interesting.  There was a buy order for  contracts posted at  on quarterly futures.  We had just set some new highs and the price was not reversing just sort of hanging out.  The quarterly futures were trading around  and it would be very tempting to open up or add to a long position expecting to be able to close into the  bid if necessary.  Well the bid got pulled and the order book got flushed fast.  It is very obvious what happened there.  It exploits top longers and those using too much leverage.  It also takes advantage of stop losses and trailing stops to create momentum.  Those who are in profit and use trailing stops lose a bit but can then reenter lower.  It also provides an opportunity to get out of short positions.  Anyway what I really dont get is this.  Why trade something if you dont have conviction about it being overpriced or underpriced?  There are so many instruments which seem clearly undervalued if you want to go long and others which seem overpriced to short.  I get using TA to choose entries and exits but I really dont understand trading bitcoin and not having an opinion about whether it is overvalued or undervalued in general.  I understand that reasonable minds might come to different conclusions and that some may really not have any conviction or think it really is ... I just dont see why you would trade it at all without some conviction about fundamental value andor the current supply vs. demand imbalance.  For me I feel like bitcoin is extremely underpriced long term assuming long term utility not a given for sure.  It is risky because the technology is not fully developed and there may yet be found a fatal flaw which cant be repaired or a technology so superior that it is destined to replace bitcoin.  I think those risks are low relative to the potential so I am a long term bull until something changes.  So I look to buy dips but I also sell rips because the path to the moon will not be straight up.  When I can I pull profits off the exchanges and store them in cold storage.  I also sometimes convert some profits to USD to pay bills etc.  I really havent seen anything with this type of potential in a long time.  It looks like it has been under accumulation.  It makes sense to me that bigger players will want in this space and they simply cant get in with the existing market cap.  My conviction as well as my stop losses allowed me to close a short postion that was  in the red  in the green during that crazy candle.  I didnt close enough longs high enough but I didnt come close to getting liquidated this time it has happened to me before and I rebought some of the closed position much lower and still have a nice green quarterly long position going.  I buy at the bottom of consolidation patterns and buy these big dips as soon as they stabilize.  It works for me much better than buying higher every time trying to catch a breakout although actually I use trigger orders to add every  or so on fast price movements.  So I guess I really try to buy tests of support and then add on breaks of resistance.  I usually take some profit at obvious points of resistance but didnt take as much this last time as usual unfortunately.....  Anyway there are lots of ways to do this and I am not saying this is the best or anything....  Also I add and take off in increments not all at once and really dont understand the idea of just picking a single buy and single sell price point.  I couldnt really get a large position to even work like that... everything is staggered and I am often selling into strength and buying weakness.  Let me also say this.  Trading is not for everyone.  Most traders lose money.  Many traders lose a lot of money.  I think many of the ones who do well avoid overtrading avoid emotional trading use stop losses and or low leverage dont trade on the advice of this board or chat rooms have discipline and conviction about what they trade and how they trade it.  I wish everyone could make money trading.  Investing works more that way buy and hold something that will have lasting value... this has a good track record.  I know this is a trading sub and I am not trying to discourage trading.  I was just moved by the note by extratrading and wanted to get some things off my chest.  I have been there too.  I traded a position of about K to over K using options on a small pharmaceutical company... which went bankrupt and I lost it all.  That was and still is a LOT of money to me.  I also lost over  bitcoins during one of the  DDOS attacks around K at the time.  I thought I was being careful and was literally sitting at my computer locked out and unable to close the position.... it was really rough...  The next day I slept all day depressed and the day after that I put my house up for sale.   has been much better.    Bitcoin doesnt have a consolidated market and the fact that orders are spread over so many exchanges really amplifies how illiquid it is.  There is evidence of shady practices at various exchanges exploiting stops etc.  Please try to manage the risk.  Dont believe that this or that entry point that someone names here is risk free.  Please dont lose money you really cant afford to lose.  If you can afford a gamble go for it!  I honestly wish you the best of luck!,2016-12-13T06:38:05.000Z,0.25

This way new users  can put in the work and get their coins instead of having to prostrate themselves to companies that are out of integrity.   There are plenty of people millions who will ensure that transactions are valid via the mining procedures we just have to adjust the way its done and lower the hash rate. It can be as simple as having everyone do proof of work and then whoever did it in  minutes is in the lottery and the dumb network does an algorithm and randomly selects like  people and divides up the bounty and sends to them.   This would solve a ton of issues. It will decentralize mining. Which is how it should be. Also this way the coinbases of the world becomes powerless as there are now millions of people mining and receiving bitcoins daily and they can sell to whoever they want whenever they want.

1294292,31.0,0,There are plenty of great introductions to bitcoin. The problem is that its very complicated. The initial reaction by most people to bitcoin is exactly the same as the initial reaction to any visionary technology that has ever been invented. People made the same arguments about electricity automobiles computers the internet et all.   All of those technologies required substantial exponential growth to be rationally feasible. But the mind has a hard time extrapolating exponentially so the first stage people go through with technologies like these is skepticism.   I used to be in the skepticism camp with bitcoin. It took many hours of study before I began to realize the huge intrinsic value that I believe bitcoin has.   That said not all technologies take off and bitcoin can fail. But if it does take off the early adopters will become wealthy and we are definitely still in the nascent stage. So my advice to people is to seriously look at bitcoin with an open mind for your wallets sake. You may be missing out on the biggest economic opportunity of our lifetimes if you make up your mind on the matter too quickly.  FWIW I think Andreas Antonopoulos gives the best case for bitcoin.

Less block space  less people can use bitcoin  more centralized. The Core people claim that bigger blocks will cause fewer people to run nodes and this will degrade the decentralized nature of  Bitcoin. There is no evidence to support this claim. It is likely that as more people adopt bitcoin its value will go up and the incentives to run a node will become stronger.,2016-12-28T20:29:02.000Z,0.25

I think Bitcoin is no bigger gamble than blind belief to governments and that they will keep economies and currencies afloat. Btc can hit zero but I am starting to think that we have crossed the moment where the probability that any fiat can hit zero is bigger.  What happens everywhere is that internet opened doors to a new economy. That economy is about effectivity. It is something that is going disrupt not just economy but whole society. Politicians do not want it. Even most people even those who are against system do not want it too. Even most bitcoiners are not revolutionaries but revisionists. They think we have just to adjust few things and go on with winwin. But what is coming is WINLOSE and most people will lose. So no wonder we are war  codefork.,2016-12-17T05:22:56.000Z,0.25

1294313,45.0,0,While this was all going on Blockstream and its employees started lobbying the community by paying for conferences about scaling bitcoin but with the very very strange rule that no decisions could be made and nothing complete solutions could be proposed. These conferences were likely strategically and successfully created to stunt support for the scaling software Gavin and Mike had released by forcing the community to take a lets wait and see what comes from the conferences kind of approach. Since no final solutions were allowed at these conferences they only served to hinder and splinter the communities efforts to find a solution. As the software Gavin and Mike released called BitcoinXT gained support it started to be attacked. Users of the software were attack by DDOS. Employees of Blockstream were recommending attacks against the software such as faking support for it to only then drop support at the last moment to put the network in disarray. Blockstream employees were also publicly talking about suing Gavin and Mike from various different angles simply for releasing this open source software that no one was forced to run. In the end Mike Hearn decided to leave due to the way many members of the bitcoin community had treated him. This was due to the massive disinformation campaign against him on rbitcoin. One of the many tactics that are used against anyone who does not support Blockstream and the bitcoin developers who work for them is that you will be targeted in a smear campaign. This has happened to a number of individuals and companies who showed support for scaling bitcoin. Theymos has threatened companies that he will ban any discussion of them on the communication channels he controls i.e. all the main ones for simply running software that he disagrees with i.e. any software that scales bitcoin.   As time passed more and more proposals were offered all against the backdrop of ever increasing censorship in the main bitcoin communication channels. It finally come down the smallest and most conservative solution. This solution was much smaller than even the employees of Blockstream had proposed months earlier. As usual there was enormous attacks from all sides and the most vocal opponents were the employees of Blockstream. These attacks still are ongoing today. As this software started to gain support Blockstream organised more meetings especially with the biggest bitcoin miners and made a pact with them. They promised that they would release code that would offer an onchain scaling solution hardfork within about  months but if the miners wanted this they would have to commit to running their software and only their software. The miners agreed and the ended up not running the most conservative proposal possible. This was in February this year. There is no hardfork proposal in sight from the people who agreed to this pact and bitcoin is still stuck with the exact same transaction limit it has had since the limit was put in place about  years ago. Gavin has also been publicly smeared by the developers at Blockstream and a plot was made against him to have him removed from the development team. Gavin has now been for all intents an purposes expelled from bitcoin development. This has meant that all control of bitcoin development is in the hands of the developers working at Blockstream.  There is a new proposal that offers a market based approach to scaling bitcoin. This essentially lets the market decide. Of course as usual there has been attacks against it and verbal attacks from the employees of Blockstream. This has the biggest chance of gaining wide support and solving the problem for good.  To give you an idea of Blockstream It has hired most of the main and active bitcoin developers and is now synonymous with the Core bitcoin development team. They AFAIK no products at all. They have received around m in funding. Every single thing they do is supported by utheymos. They have started implementing an entirely new economic system for bitcoin against the will of its users and have blocked any and all attempts to scaling the network in line with the original vision.  Although this comment is ridiculously long it really only covers the tip of the iceberg. You could write a book on the last two years of bitcoin. The things that have been going on have been mind blowing. One last thing that I think is worth talking about is the ubashcos claim of vote manipulation.  The users that the video talks about have very very large numbers of downvotes mostly due to them having a very very high chance of being astroturfers. Around about the same time last year when Blockstream came active on the scene every single bitcoin troll disappeared and I mean literally every single one. In the years before that there were a large number of active antibitcoin trolls. They even have an active sub rbuttcoin. Up until last year you could go down to the bottom of pretty much any thread in rbitcoin and see many of the usual trolls who were heavily downvoted for saying something along the lines of bitcoin is shit You guys and your tulips etc. But suddenly last year they all disappeared. Instead a new type of bitcoin user appeared. Someone who said they were fully in support of bitcoin but they just so happened to support every single thing Blockstream and its employees said and did. They had the exact same tone as the trolls who had disappeared. Their way to talking to people was aggressive theyd call people names they had a relatively poor understanding of how bitcoin fundamentally worked. They were extremely argumentative. These users are the majority of the list of that video. When the s of thousands of users were censored and expelled from rbitcoin they ended up congregating in rbtc. The strange thing was that the users listed in that video also moved over to rbtc and spend all day everyday posting trolllike comments and misinformation. Naturally they get heavily downvoted by the real users in rbtc. They spend their time constantly causing as much drama as possible. At every opportunity they scream about censorship in rbtc while they are happy about the censorship in rbitcoin. These people are astroturfers. What someone somewhere worked out is that all you have to do to take down a community is say that you are on their side. It is an astoundingly effect form of psychological attack. Its the exact kind of attack being discussed in this video.  That is what is so insane about this video. The video is talking about vote manipulation against this list of users. But the actual list of users are the ones doing the damn manipulation. This is how insane the world of information has got. The astrotrufers are being presented as the victims. Its just insane,2016-12-16T01:17:31.000Z,0.25

1294320,53.0,0,Unfortunately this article contains many outright untruths.  This it too long for anyone to address point by point probably will take people days of effort to do so but some random examples   gt Most seriously there are no enforceable constraints to the growth of the nonSW UTXO.  Sure there is the amount of nonwitness data in a block ends up with the same limit it always had.  One of the reasons we were able to convince people worried about a blocksize increase that segwits capacity increase was safe was because it did not increase the UTXO bloat exposure.  gt This makes future soft or hard forks to Bitcoin more difficult as multiple classes of UTXOs  There arent multiple classes of UTXO they are all equal differing only in their scriptPubkey just like  of  multsig is different from  of . And just like a transaction can combine multisig and nonmultisig using scripts they can also combine segwit and nonsegwit using.  gt However the signatures are more expensive to validate than the UTXO  That isnt the case signature validation is one of the faster parts of block validation since our work on libsecpk and unlike the rest it is perfectly parallelizable. On my desktop signature verification is more than  times faster than the rest of the process.  It is also perfectly prunable so it doesnt result in a long time storage cost for full nodes.  The pages pseudonymous author also behaves quite dishonestly with claims like  gt Greg Maxwell has postulated that abandoned UTXO should be forgotten and become unspendable  which is referring to a page which _explicitly_ says otherwise some of this represents different security and economic tradeoffs and I dont think those could be ethically imposed on Bitcoin even if a simple majority of users wanted them as theyd be forced onto the people who dont want them. Ive been highly outspoken that that kind of thing isnt an option for Bitcoin although it is _technically_ interesting because it would address some long term issues. In Bitcoin we need to use different approaches to control UTXO bloat such as those which are part of segwit.,2016-12-21T19:37:40.000Z,0.25

I have no idea what the conversation would be like if we had a failed hard fork or critical failure to the likes of the one that occurred early in bitcoins history. The reason why I dont think that failure ruined bitcoin forever is because It happened when there werent enough people around to see it. We have no idea what would happen if a failure with a similar magnitude occurred again and quite frankly I dont ever want to find out.

1294333,16.0,0,For Bitcoins system to work at all a supermajority eg gt of economic activity must be received by people running their own full nodes under their own physical control. We dont have a good way to measure this right now but I think everyone would agree that the current situation is abysmally failing in this regard.  Additionally the IBD costs continually increase faster than technological improvement handling them. Calculations show that in order to keep IBD costs the same after taking into account tech improvements the average block size should be no greater than k.  Current legitimate onchain demand is indeed far in excess of k I estimate about kk average per block so clearly we cannot simply cap the block size to k today. But similarly increasing the block size when we dont need to is somewhat foolish and risks Bitcoins longterm survival. It is an acceptable risk which is why most people are willing to accept it as a compromise but it would objectively be better not to do it. Hopefully miners will avoid increasing the defacto ie softlimit block size even after segwit activates.  Note that once Lightning goes live and starts to acquire usage we may see a substantial drop in blockspace demand perhaps bringing Bitcoin below the k marker at least temporarily. But that is still yet to be demonstrated in practice.,2016-12-17T04:39:13.000Z,0.25

Monero has tons of challenges both immediate and long term not least of which is the challenge of public perception as respects privacy.

At the same time Coinbase was very vocal about the direction Bitcoin was heading in zero growth. Yay we got there! Adding ETH to their exchange was a no brainer _at the time_ before The DAO.

1294373,-9.0,0,DingDing.  This is the correct answer.  Bitcoin was never designed to be used as a payment method for all transactions.  Whether people like it or not this is the direction things will eventually go  gtActually there is a very good reason for Bitcoinbacked banks to exist issuing their own digital cash currency redeemable for bitcoins. Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient. Likewise the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize will be impractical for medium to large value purchases.  gtBitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalization of currency. Different banks can have different policies some more aggressive some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve while others may be  Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others.  gtGeorge Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail and he argues that such a system would be stable inflation resistant and selfregulating.  gtI believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin to be the highpowered money that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks to settle net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as... well as Bitcoin based purchases are today.   gtHal Finney gt,2016-12-28T01:27:00.000Z,0.25

Turns out the Core wallet was on there the entire time. Then he was called a scammer for putting an online casino on his site. He has unofficially been uninvited from bitcoin conferences organized with the help of Core and Blockstream just like the BU devs. I guess you could call it a softblacklisting.  Mike had it far worse. He was the primary target in the FUD campaign propagated by Core which labels any other client not in agreement with certain policies altcoin scammers and he was dragged through the mud for months until he basically gave up working on bitcoin entirely. According to GMax if somebody such as myself who used to be a huge supporter of Core makes a post about XT it is considered a sybill attack. This isnt even what you could call a soft blacklisting.

I am no expert in the field of payments but its my understanding that micro payments refers to payments measured in cents rather than dollars and nano payment is fractions of a cent.   Nobody has seriously argued that on chain micro payments were ever part of the scope of bitcoin. From memory Satoshi himself said in forum posts that layer  solutions for micro payments were the logical solution.

1294419,15.0,0,Because it isnt a good proposal it does less than segwit while being brutally incompatible with every piece of Bitcoin software ever written. After introducing an incompatible transaction format in the elements alpha sidechain and seeing similar pain in various altcoins I am doubtful that such a thoroughly incompatible change could ever be deployed especially without providing clear value. Because of this more than any thing else you wont see this proposal get much review or attention.  As it was originally proposed it had a design flaw that enabled coin theft and its original implementation had at least three buffer overflow vulnerabilities... these are strong signals that it is excessively complex.  Even the name of it is dishonest marketing calling itself flexible while it strictly decreased flexibility. Contrary to its claims it actually makes transactions less efficient  and private by allowing the ordering of various fields to be arbitrary but the ordering is still normative even though it conveys no meaning.  The whole design confuses the consensus rules with the byte serialization of a transaction theyre separate things and further conflating them wouldnt be an improvement to the system. It is also significantly less efficient in that design to send a block to someone without its signatures adding  bytes of overhead per transaction comes out to about  for median sized transactions.,2016-12-05T00:45:21.000Z,0.25

1294424,15.0,0,Yes I see it. You dont. Censorship in action!   Here is what I wrote  gtThe only technical complaint Ive heard about segwit was that its complicated. Id be curious to know if there are others.  I am violently opposed to bait and switch SegWit as a soft fork and would support SegWit with a size increase as a hard fork as originally promised. Hopefully the below will satisfy your curiosity as to why.          size_t nSize  GetSerializeSizethis SER_DISK          int witnessversion           stdvectorltunsigned chargt witnessprogram          if scriptPubKey.IsWitnessProgramwitnessversion witnessprogram               sum the sizes of the parts of a transaction input              with  BLOCKSTREAM_CORE_BANKSTER_DISCOUNT applied             nSize          BANKSTER_SCALE_FACTOR            else              nSize            the  mentioned above         gt   This is the C soft fork SegWit code that gives signature data a  discount. The makes digital signatures which make up a bigger portion of PSH transactions four times cheaper than other transaction data.  This discount was never discussed or debated. It was simply inserted into the code by core developers who you come to your own conclusion are being paid by Blockstream. Blockstream is a private company that took m in corporate venture capital money from companies such as AXA and Digital Currency Group which is partly owned by Western Union.  Before banning me or censoring me please note that everything I have written so far is  factual and verifiable and this trend will continue below. If this post is censored I will make sure everyone knows about it.  Now complicated PSH transactions are needed for sidechains and Lightning Network. That gives Lightning Network and sidechains an economic advantage over regular Bitcoin transactions.    In addition to no one really using it today which makes it a dubious replacement for Bitcoin Lightning Network has centralized routing that creates big hubs banks. This is because the routing solutions proposed today flare and onion are naturally going to look for the shortest cheapest route which encourages bigger hubs with more Bitcoin locked up.  Therefore soft fork SegWit is going to forever alter Bitcoin and give an unfair advantage to companies like Blockstream that plan to make money from lightning and sidechains.   Personally Ill never let soft fork SegWit activate. The miners and businessuser community that hasnt been bought off wants a hard fork size increase and SegWit as a hard fork without the  discount that was inserted into the code by developers who are paid by Blockstream without any public debate.  The fact that weve waited this long to scale is setting Bitcoin back years. Circle leaving is another warning sign. Investment and interest drying up is another sign.  So thats my technical complaint and the economic ramifications of why I dont want a  discount in the C for PSH transactions because Blockstream said so.,2016-12-11T21:22:54.000Z,0.25

1294426,37.0,0,If the virus is slowing your computer it may be using it as part of a botnet or may be using it to mine cryptocurrencies like bitcoin for profit.  Botnets are networks of infected computers that can be remotely controlled in some way by a command and control server and directed to do tasks. One common task will be using it in a DDOS Distributed Denial of Service in which each computer in the botnet makes a huge number of network requests to another computer or network with the hopes of bringing it down. People with large botnets will often sell the usage of the botnets to others who will use it to bring down targets or as a mask for another type of hack against a target. While the attack is active it may put load on your computers network and maybe the processor depending on the type of attack resulting in the slowness you describe  Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are types of electronic currency and can be traded for goodsservices or traded to others for money. One of the ways cryptocurrencies are generated are by having a computer do proofofwork which boils down to doing a lot of processor intensive math until it finds a number that matches an unclaimed piece of currency this is a simplification. This can take a lot of computing power so infecting thousands or millions of other computers to do the work and eat the electricity cost while you reap the benefits can be quite profitable. While its doing proofofwork it will put a high load on your computers cpu andor gpu graphics card which can result in the slowness you describe.  tldr They sometimes infect your computer to be a zombie slave attacking others and making money on the hackers command.,2016-12-18T03:50:08.000Z,0.25

I get where youre coming from you think mass adoption will make it difficult for a politician to say lock up the masses but this wont prevent regulators from forcing Bitcoin to be what they want. In fact Roger is willing to take a risk in giving regulators that opportunity to reach mass adoption...so this is a contradiction in itself...  But more to the point. Imagine a world where Bitcoin is adopted enmasse and governments have to deal with it.  The first thing theyll do which they are already doing is forcing procurement channels to utilize KYC to track who uses Bitcoin and limit who can use it. You may say well use Localbitcoins however Localbitcoin is illegal to use in New York. If you trade on the street of New York and its an undercover cop you will go to jail. As a result there has been an increase in violence in New York via Bitcoin related activity.   How in that situation will mass adoption repeal the Bitlicense? How will it give me more freedom?

1294440,-6.0,0,Unlike bitcoin Ethereum is not scarce. The primary developer of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin has stated that the reasoning behind this is a technical one. Once bitcoin reaches its  million maximum coins mined the miners maintaining the public ledger have a lesser incentive to do so if their reward is only a small fee from each transaction. Therefore the Ethereum supply was designed to be inflationary and unlimited to keep the block rewards for the miners constant. In this state the Ethereum programmed system of value is more accurately described as a system of devalue. Ethereums genesis block alone creates  million coins over five times the current supply of bitcoin. New coins are mined at a rate of  Ethers a day. At a  inflation rate for the year and decreasing slowly Ethereums inflation rate still doesnt meet the U.S. targeted  inflation rate until the year .  More importantly   Ethereum is not primarily intended to be a store of value. Its meant to be used and exchanged frequently as cryptofuel   odds.,2016-12-12T07:11:06.000Z,0.25

Youre part of a group of people advocating remaking Bitcoin from what was originally proposed into a different kind of thing altogether  and they call this utter transformation of the moneyconcept immutability!?!  Its astonishing the doublespeak they use if you arent paying attention.  Turning Bitcoin from PP cash into PP settlement gold is literally mutability of the money in the most profound sense possible.  Particularly when you have also worked in scalable information systems and you believe in a vision of Bitcoin that scales onchain as I do.  Thats the real immutability keeping the money concept the same.  So I go back to the original question that you kinda ducked.  When did you give up on PP cash as proposed in the white paper and believe that only a radically different vision could ever work?  Edit I have no problem with people wanting LN to work  I have a problem with having vaporware jammed on top of the vision of Bitcoin that isnt being allowed to work.  There are a lot of great ideas for onchain scaling that are being squashed by Cores politics.  Stop foisting your Layer  solution onto Layer s scaling problem.  Layer  should scale to support as many transactions onchain as securely feasible.  Layer  can stand or fall on its own.  You claim a background in information systems.

1294452,19.0,0,The fundamental problem is that the present designers of Bitcoin Core have a fundamentally broken understanding of how queuing systems work.  They are attempting to patch up the broken system they have created through a series of mechanisms that can not possibly work.  The symptoms are excessive resource consumption associated with broadcasting transactions through the mempool.  This includes initial broadcasting rebroadcasting and rebroadcasting with higher fees RBF. The further optimizations being discussed in this thread are just minor consequences of this fundamentally incorrect approach.   There are only two possible solutions to queueing problems in an overloaded network.  The first solution is to increase the capacity of the network in the case of Bitcoin it includes increasing the maximum block size and if necessary increaing the hardware provisioning required for increased capacity.  The second solution is to decrease the traffic load on the network.  In the case of Bitcoin this would be done by increasing the minimum fees required by nodes before they accept any new user transactions to broadcast them. Using an interactive mechanism that requires multiple transmissions of the same transaction to increase fees is not an effective way to use available network capacity which is physically limited by transmission capacity and processing capacity both of which are utilized for each broadcast of a single transaction.  This entire discussion comes about from an assbackward solution to an artificially created problem.  None if this discussion would be happening if the people in charge of Bitcoin were competent in understanding the behavior of realtime computer systems whether or not distributed.,2016-12-20T04:06:03.000Z,0.25

What do you think the cost of that transaction would be worth? Is . too high? What about . . .? Ive worked too hard for my money traded pieces of my life for it protecting the value of my money is important to me as it is likely important to everyone else and Ill be damned if Im going to risk losing the best safe haven to be created since the big bang because I want cheap transactions. Rushing a hard fork for cheap transactions so that everyone in the world can afford them is just plain not a good enough argument for me want to risk ruining this sanctuary currency right now.

1294456,15.0,0,I actually worked for PayPal for a few years and am familiar with the how and why of some of their practices though its been a few years.  If youre going to run a business using it Id encourage people to actually read their user agreement.  Ultimately the aim is to protect consumers from fraud.  Which may sound inconvenient as a seller but this was a real problem in the early days of random people selling stuff online. Imagine the exact opposite like an eBay with only anonymous sellers taking bitcoin payments.  Some people may thing this sounds great but there would be zero incentive to actually fulfill your obligations and without accountability the entire system would quickly collapse.  The tricky bit is  finding a balance where consumers are protected and sellers get paid.  No doubt theyve had a number of blunders and PR nightmares in the past working on perfecting that balance but usually the system is relatively fair.  If you open a new account and immediately start receiving a ton of payments without a history or thoroughly proving your identity they are going to look pretty hard at you.  Without this scrutiny youd see people taking tons of payments for a promise of an amazing magical widget withdrawing all of it and disappearing leaving countless people without their money or the widget complaining about how they werent protected against the fraud.  Its a pain in the ass sure but better than the alternative of zero security.  Not like the money is going anywhere once you prove youre legit youll get it and if youre not legit that money goes back to the buyers.  Not like you can get a house loan with a fake ID and no background check.  The main valid criticism is how fast they process your information and release the funds.  Its better than it used to be but could use some improvement.  They are a popular choice for new business because of the fast easy setup.  But if youre going to move a lot of money throguh them its good to be aware of their business practices which is in the fine print.

I believe fee markets will exists but just asking a few what if questions and doing some calculations very quickly reveals what that fee market is likely to look like in equilibrium.   How we reach that equilibrium seems to be the problem though. For me attempts to create an artificial market are misguided and premature. Though I accept others feel differently.  Id just go back to the simple maths of it all   Size of block x Satoshis per byte  block reward gt Cost of block production  So long as that holds true then bitcoin works.  When you start plugging numbers into that equation then you get a distribution of fairly reasonable possibilities.

If miners would put actual transactions before spam they could all make it in the very next block. It is miners who are deciding to delay transactions if any are indeed delayed.  gt The space on hdds would be used anyway all its about is time.  Thats not a given. Price out the spam and it will never get mined. Eventually nodes will prune it from their mempool and reject it as well.  The original purpose of the block size limit is to prevent miners from mining too much spam. Since then weve also learned that actually using Bitcoin ie not just trusting random other people requires a full node which means we cant rely on datacentreclass resources for processing the blockchain and need to keep the resource requirements low enough for home nodes around the world.,2016-12-06T07:38:34.000Z,0.0

1294492,-4.0,1,i love free lunches just as much as the next guy but decentralized networks are inherently less efficient than centralized ones. any efficiency that is gained is due to the fact that it is sidestepping regulations which add an additional burden on the system. If bitcoin takes off in any real way and is allowed to exist outside of black and grey markets and is found to be efficient then centralized institutions will quickly close the gap to be able to compete thus making the edge that bitcoin has in that area nonexistant. that means that once they are capable of competing on an equal playing field that bitcoin will become more expensive than centralized services.  what make bitcoin interesting and robust long term is the fact that it is censorship resistant not the fact that it is so durn cheapthough creative people certainly could find solutions to make it cheaper.  just like how bit torrent is much less efficient than netflix people still use it because it skirts around regulations and allows people to violate copyright law. these decentralized systems are not around because they are more effecient or even better than their centralized counterparts the regulations just make them a necessity.,2016-12-14T05:47:20.000Z,0.25
1294493,-18.0,1,gt Bitcoin Unlimiteds fast block relay Xpedited is the only decentralized fast block relay solution in Bitcoin  This is simply untrue.  Xpedited does nothing more than the high bandwidth mode of BIP deployed on and used by about  of all reachable nodes. BIP HB mode is used automatically without special configuration unlike BUs protocol and it also resists malicious shortid collisions and needs less data to communicate its compacted blocks.  Using Xpedited instead of plain old Bitcoin Core would be a step back.  And Id hardly call those figures _fast_ a network of nodes running fibre shares a block around then _entire world_ in the time cited here for crossing between two nodes.  and does so even when the transactions in the block are surprising ones so it doesnt depend on highly consistent mempool behavior and does so even when the networks are losing packets so its not just fast sometimes but all the time. The Xpedited numbers here are best case ones assuming strong mempool similarity but closer to worst case is a lot more important.  Edit Dont expect any replies from me MemoryDealers paid staff appear to have decided to put the rate limiting back on my account so I wont be able to reply in a sensible time or otherwise engage in conversation.  Edit Since I cant reply directly Solex wrote  gt Lyin Greg comes back from suspension and resumes lyin.  gt You keep parroting about collisions which dont happen even though Xthin has been live for most of this year. One user recently reported TB saved on bandwidth in a month. FIBRE network run by Blockstream employee using a few choice private servers does NOT  decentralization. It would be nice if you finally admitted that Xpedited is superior in not only design but also performance AND decentralization.  collisions which dont happen  collisions happen whenever someone wants to bother making them happen this is how security vulnerabilities work.  Since Xthin is used on only a tiny number of nodes its generally not worth it to bother attacking it no one would even notice. Just because someone isnt actively exploiting something at the moment that doesnt mean its not vulnerable. This weak design also makes xthin use  more data to communicate its compacted blocks.  Xthin has been live for most of this year xthin that actually worked sure hasnt been but here youre not even talking about xthin but Xpedited the uncredited clone of BIP HB mode.  FIBRE is a protocol and software that implements it everyone can run it,2016-12-08T04:19:40.000Z,0.25

1294495,38.0,0,It is literally impossible to have a forprofit company with no conflict of interest when it comes to a publiclyowned utility.

Bottled water companies want to capture a certain amount of spring water from a spring which they do not own. Other types of companies that do not own those springs or underground tunnels also want to use them for their own profit making.   Blockstream does not own the bitcoin network. Nobody does. Each company wishes to influence the network for their own profit motives. They all have a conflict of interest. Coinbase wants the network to better serve their online wallet and exchange products. Trezor wants bitcoin to work more efficiently with their hardware wallets.   Ive asked several people on the other side of the blocksize debate about what the conflict of interest might be regarding Blockstream. Almost every time I get told that there is nothing.

However I would also say that a number of other financial products available fall into this category. Just because Ive no interest does not mean there is no market  and I recognize that there is a market for it. I can envision a future in which LNstyle transacting is the norm and in that future I can see myself tying up funds in channels to facilitate commerce.  However that future is very detached from the actual present  the road from here to there is paved with questionable materials.

Theres a lot of Kenyans whose incomes  or their businesses incomes  are comparable to those in western countries yet could still benefit greatly from the easier capital movement that Bitcoin provides. Equally those same people could benefit greatly from true scaling solutions like Lightning... but thats no different than anywhere else in the world.  I was on two panels while I was there and one of the points I made during that was we shouldnt start by assuming everything in Africa is totally unlike western countries and the problems we face are completely dissimilar. Kenya is still a capitalist democracy with uncensored internet  in fact better mobile internet than I can get at home. They still eat similar food and have similar brands as back home. Sure theres a lot thats different  for instance the amount of private security in Kenya is beyond any other place Ive ever been  but by assuming everything is different biases you to assuming that you cant learn from each other and we certainly can.

1294546,21.0,0,The genius of this approach is easy to overlook in the details so I want to call it out.   The genius of this approach is that it eliminates the takeitorleaveit blackandwhite st generation voting mechanism that Satoshi left us with which has been Bitcoins political Achilles heel. Let me explain.   Satoshi explained that proof of work could serve as a sybildiscouraging voting mechanism. Many of us loved Bitcoin for that aspect of it voting incentives are strongly biased to favor only code changes that result in greater economic utility and efficiency.  However the binary decision logic employed in the first gen code a block is always either completely valid else it is completely invalid creates a toopowerful disincentive to mine a challenger block for other miners to vote on with their hashpower.  But the boolean logic makes no engineering sense. For example the network has no way of differentiating how it reacts to these blocks   . A . MB block  . A  GB block   . A block that pays the miner  BTC  All of these are held to be equally valid  invalid under the current consensus logic. Clearly they are not all equally objectionable!  What is needed is a way for nodes to express more fine grained control over their voting logic. Your approach represents a very elegant way of empowering the users with the ability to do more than simply accept or reject but to express finegrained preferences.,2016-12-19T18:39:08.000Z,0.25

I think we may have a good case here for appealing to the wiki mod and getting all the implementations included.  A wiki mod has already been into the talk page and removed all nontechnical stuff.  I think the defence of BU and classic must be   There are nonpolitical reasons of using BU and Classic one does get some unique technical benefits of using BU rather than core i.e. Extreme Thinblocks and systemd support straight out of the package.   The network does not get disrupted merely by nodeowners using alternative software.    For users using BU or classic is perfectly safe.  With the current statusquo BU classic knots and bitcore works completely compatibly with Bitcoin Core this is not unproven software this is software that is used in production settings today.  If a big majority of miners and the industry as such were to upgrade to BU or classic and adopt a new defacto MBblocks then BU and classic would just continue work  while Bitcoin Coreusers would simply experience that bitcoin stops working.   Yes indeed unfortunately this has become a hot political question.  The bitcoin community has indeed been teared into two camps and one is indeed implicitly sort of giving a vote in the debate by choosing one software over the other.

1294583,21.0,0,gt This is so obvious you are trying to talk others into doing this to benefit your position.  This is an absurd accusation which I find so frustrating that Im now going to rant.  Im trying to be a helpful participant in a trading sub. Youre running around yelling troll! at everyone who says something which might dare indicate that ETH is not headed for the moon tomorrow and then claim that Im the one trying to bolster MY position? Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.  Your obvious observation is nothing more than naivete and shortsightedness.   I essentially told people to make their decision now and stick with it to not get burned. Why? Because there are a lot of noobs around here and its how Ive gotten burned in the past and others inevitably will. You may not want to admit it but ETH is in a downtrend and BTC is in an uptrend on very low volume. That means its real and the bubble hasnt even started yet. When BTC explodes a lot of these true eth believers will capitulate and try to make some quick eth and as a result get burned.  TROLL TROLL TROLL! OMG ETH MUST BE AT  TOMORROW and FOREVER ANYTHING ELSE IS BLATANT MANIPULATION BY WHALES AND YOULL NEVER LOSE IF YOU JUST HODL LIKE A TRUE BELIEVER SHOULD!   . The markets care very little about the fundamentals or the arguments going on around these technologies except as they feel it might immediately influence the price.  . The markets care primarily about which way the markets appear to be going. Up trend? BUY! Down trend? SELL!  . It didnt take mainstream adoption to reach  and it didnt take mainstream adoption for it to reach  after being declared dead. So why on earth would it take mainstream adoption to reach  or ?   Heres my position    Bought  BTC at each in . OMG MOON TO k! hodled as a good noob should and got burned.  Bought k ETH at the ICO sold them for about  last December to pay off debts thinking id have no problem buying back in march for about the same.   Saw Mike Hearn leave the BTC team and lost faith in the project cashed out Bitcoin to buy back into Ethereumabout  ETH.  Been trying to regain my original ETH position ever since. Decided that this was my priority and that virtue signaling about the technology is a nowin game.  Sold my ETH for bitcoin about a week ago waiting to buy back into ETH as I believe that BTC is ultimately a suicided technology having suffocated itself with infighting manipulation and all the things that that very community supposedly stands against.   I have about a hundred more ETH in unrealized gains thus far I expect to get another hundred while people like you are screaming hodl! and your eth stack is staying the same size or your fiat stack is getting smaller as you buy more.   gt you are trying to talk others into doing this to benefit your position.  For the record not everybody here is convinced that a random internet post by a nobody on a tiny subreddit is enough to influence the market. Just apply a tiny bit of logic to your accusation please. The kind of traders who would take partisan investment advice from a sub like this would most likely be holding so little ETH that it would do NOTHING to anyones position except their own. Is it not possible that someone is actually genuinely interested in just trying to be helpfulregardless of whether or not you agree with their advice?

The way you came across was quite confident but reading your post its apparent that you dont understand LN and probably havent read the whitepaper.  gt How are Hubs held accountable anyways? Are their ledgers public? Who is going to enforce this and how can they?  Please go back and read the white paper or watch the presentations from Poon.  Just to clarify one point LN transactions are Bitcoin transactions. How would you use LN to do fractional reserve? Can you create a bitcoin transaction that has more outputs than inputs  thereby creating new bitcoin? No... it would be an invalid transaction. But since all LN transactions are bitcoin transactions and all LN transactions must follow all of the rules of bitcoin then it should be obvious that no one will use LN network to do fractional reserve.  Again I would highly suggest that you watch the Poon videos and read the white paper.  gt You are forced to use the LN as a channel maybe not a specific hub but you are no longer able to transact on the chain without an intermediary.  Dude... what are you talking about? No one will be forced to use LN.  gt you are no longer able to transact on the chain without an intermediary  What do you mean by this? All LN transactions are Bitcoin transactions and must follow all of the rules of Bitcoin. There is a sense in which all LN transactions are on chain its just that all of the intermediate states are not published.  Why is on the chain without an intermediary so important to you? I suppose its because youre concerned with preserving the censorship resistant and immutable nature and trustless nature of Bitcoin transactions. For most cases LN will provide those same features using the Bitcoin blockchain although without publishing the intermediate states.  If your insinuation is that LN uses a trusted counterparty then you simply dont understand LN.,2016-12-08T06:19:38.000Z,0.25

1294637,53.0,0,gt Is there an aircraft hanger where thousands of bitcoiners dredge the internet for Ethereum comments and reply the same day with negative comments such as ...  Pretty much yes.  You have to realize there is a LOT of money tied up in Bitcoin a failing technology BTW.  Most of that money is from lowinformation investors who havent done their homework and likely bought into it because they heard of or saw somebody else doing it or because a trusted source advised them to.  Beyond that they see gains for now and arent interested in hearing about the true underlying problems that are literally crippling BTCs future.  Along comes Ethereum which on both paper and in practice does everything that Bitcoin does and then a whole lot more.  So defensiveness ensues along with outright attacks in the form of what you describe in your submission text.  That being said no crypto that makes its way to becoming mainstream is going to do so without passing through trial after trial of fire.  TheDAO was not an Ethereum protocol problem.  It was  lines of flawed contract code that were exploited and allowed for the funds of TheDAO to be stolen.   months is a long time in crypto and thats how long it has been.  Its pretty far in the past and I personally would answer no TheDAO is absolutely NOT giving Ethereum a hangover.  There are certainly BTC people that wish that were the case.  But the reality is any worthwhile emerging technology which is what Ethereum really is is going to find its own way through the boom gt bust gt boom gt bust gt ad infinitum cycle.  When were in a bust phase all of the BTC people who fear Ethereum will attempt to persuade anyone willing to listen that TheDAO proves Ethereum is useless.  Amazingly during the booms those same people are nowhere to be found.  Funny how that works isnt it?  Anyway TheDAO is long gone.  TONS of improvements have happened since then  ranging from DevCon to Solidity analysis tools to protocol improvements and optimizations to a variety of other ICOs and the list goes on.,2016-12-17T14:10:36.000Z,0.25

1294646,35.0,0,One danger of time travel to keep in mind is that since the supply of BTC is very limited if you acquired BTC in  you might deprive someone notable of BTC which could perhaps influence their actions in a way which negatively impacts Bitcoins growth. For example ArtForz one of the biggest early miners reported to Satoshi several absolutely critical bugs which couldve utterly destroyed Bitcoin if not handled very early on. If someone had tempted him with the offer of buying all of his BTC at the amazinglyhigh price of BTC or whatever maybe he wouldve left the Bitcoin community earlier than he did in reality before he wouldve found these bugs.

1294677,22.0,0,This part might explain a lot of why Roger has reached incorrect conclusions  gt??? Roger whats the importance of nodes in the bitcoin network to you?  gtRV So the importance of nodes in bitcoin to me is to provide the redundancy in the blockchain right? The more copies of the blockchain in the world the harder it is for someone to say its a fake copy of the blockchain that undoes certain transactions or whatever. Someone else can say no theres thousands of copies. Its not the right one. So the more copies of the blockchain the more difficult it is for people to censor bitcoin. And the more choices that SPV wallet users have for connecting to nodes. We dont need  of the people using hte bitcoin protocol to be running full nodes that implement the protocol.  So when you believe the only purpose of a node is to be redundant file storage and nothing more of course you will neglect the importance of running one.  You see this kind of incorrect logic from a lot of people saying miners have the power to do anything include change consensus rules such as coin reward but they just have an economic incentive not to since the price might drop.,2016-12-15T01:09:05.000Z,0.25

The core bitcoin stash I hold is not for sale.  But make no mistake that chasing another  from bitcoin isnt that interesting to me. Ether can rise  and still be just at the ATH.  Trading isnt just buying what has an upward sloping line on a chart and selling what is pointing down. The people who are painting those charts rely upon it to nudge the market where they want it but they dont follow those principles.  The real money is made buying the lower  of a bear market that is buying something that that is unpopular say bitcoin at  and holding it until it rises. Are there guarantees? No.   Do i think buying  ether this month will return a lot more over the coming  than buying BTC at ? You bet. Or rather I take that bet. And so I will continue to layer in progressively bigger buys if it falls further.   If ether falls further because new money buy the bitcoin top or suggest it then I will accumulate more. I have time on my side  this is play money.   Right now the meme is that ethereum is worthless. The fear angle being pushed is it will fall to nothing. The reality is those POVs are highly irrational for what is still the second biggest cryptocurrency in the space a cryptocurrency which has the most development in the entire space and an actual roadmap which could make the ethereum rise this year seem insignificant.

The details of the bet only refer to the block height not the block difficulty so here is how you build a chain that satisfies the requirements as written in the bet.  Starting with the genesis block build a new chain with empty blocks of difficulty  with timestamps up to almost the end of Sept .  This chain will be a little behind with regards to height of where the real chain will be in Sept  and a lot behind with regards to total work.  But remember the bet has nothing to do with how much work is in the chains the bet only mentions block height.  To make up the difference start mining chunks of  blocks whose timestamps are  second apart at the end of the chain.  The difficulty can only go up by a factor of  per set of  blocks so we can begin making up the missing height.  Doing some napkin math there are  days between the genesis block and the end of September .  Building a chain of difficulty  up to that point in time will have height   .  Based on the height of the blockchain today we can estimate that the real Bitcoin blockchain will have height  by the end of Sept  perhaps a little higher.  So our fake difficulty chain will be behind by around  blocks.  By adding  chunks of  blocks to the end of our low difficulty chain more than make up for the needed height while only raising the difficulty to   .  The current difficulty is  so the difficulty of our fake chain ends up less than . of the real chains difficulty today.  Throw a larger than  MB block in at  blocks before the end of the fake chain by padding it with garbage data and we satisfy the requirements of condition .  To satisfy condition  we just need to add a few thousand more blocks to ensure the real chain doesnt exceed the height of our fake chain.  This is easy to do because remember the difficulty of our fake chain is . of the difficulty of the real chain even though our fake chain is longer.  Id be tempted to bet yes given the wording of the bet but Id worry that they would pull a DAO and change the terms of the contract on me.,2016-12-26T05:18:01.000Z,0.25
1294693,25.0,0,Im very happy about the initiative taken here and even ecstatic to hear that youve pulled together m for advertising fees.   I am however PISSED that these three bland factless spots are the best youve come up with. Hell a simple search on Youtube for the word bitcoin returns a hundred or more far more interesting videos to pull source material from.  The thing that makes these ad spots completely utterly ineffective is that they shy away from the facts. Accepted on Mars?? I GUARANTEE that this spot will be a blight on bitcoins reputation not help it in any way.  The kid running was in poor taste and any parent target demo watching it will immediately think WTF? Why are those druggies pushing their anonymous currency used on the Silk Road at my toddler??! Im calling the cops!  The third one was only slightly cringeworthy but not offensive. Still it was completely ineffective because it didnt impart any facts or impressive features of the borderless internet money that does what nothing else on earth has ever accomplished. The user learns Zilch.  I understand that stock footage was used to lower costs. This is just one of those cases where stock footage isnt going to cut it...

1294697,33.0,0,Youre simply misinformed.  Firstly while this sub is moderated and hasnt gotten right every single time they have taken steps to provide full transparency.  Theres a link on the sidebar to the mod log.   You can see who banned who for what and you can have a dialog about that.   They really only ban people who get belligerent.  As for  being all thats needed for segwit thats just crazy talk.   Even the die hards in the core camp dont believe that.   Not even close.   You understand that segwit will appear to the  as anyone can spend and someone could just mine a block where they spend your money to themselves right?    Even if you had  support some nonzero amount could be stolen.  gt Both forks are going to suffer from being unable to mine blocks for  weeks.  No one is talking about producing larger blocks at less than a super majority of miners supporting UL.    It would not be in their interests.   And once its clear its forking any selfinterested miners who had held out will be under overwhelming financial incentive to switch.  But lets say only  fork the new chain.   Sure that will result in a slower rate of block discovery.   But guess what....those blocks can hold more transactions.   The mean time for highfee transactions will increase but the overall transaction rate need not change.    LN does not even exist yet.  Its vaporware.  And even in concept it has not solved major issues such as decentralized routing.   Theres nothing wrong with having a centralized product sitting on top of bitcoin but it should not be the only path.   Further LN wont work without a block size increase as it still has to settle on the chain.   If many people try to exit their LN channel at the same time without a block increase it will cause a massive failure and loss of funds.,2016-12-19T03:39:05.000Z,0.25

I believe Im not alone in this. You say do this to give value but messing with social contract of a currency will destroy value and trust in it so we could end up with having something with fixed supply but worthless because it betrayed all the people helping to build it. Just because you strongly feel like its the way to go doesnt make it the right thing to do. You say openminded discussion but I dont see you having an open mind about it.

1294721,14.0,0,Glad their are other people who share my thoughts. I came to know about Bitcoin when my company started talking about Blockchain. Initially I had a hard time to find out how to buy Bitcoin. Then I bought my first Bitcoins on Coinbase with USD. They charged me fees but it was ok for smooth Bitcoin buying experience. Then I saw one more tab in Coinbase with the name ETH. I wondered whats this ETH? I Googled about ETHEthereum and landed on Ethereum.org. I read as much as I can about Ethereum including White Paper. Then I found Devcon videos on YouTube and after watching them it blown my mind. I quickly bought some ETH on higher price than current though I am not worried really. Now I have  ETH. I buysell small amount of Bitcoins sometimes. But as I worked in Banks for half a decade I know how much Banks and Governments are serious about moneylaundering. So I am Bitcoin scepticI respect if you disagree with me on this.

I think it would also be nice if somehow we could implement some sort of ruleset against misinformation but that would likely be difficult to achieve. Currently the only rules we have are . No sourcing and . Be nice neither of which are followed particularly well. We should help each other out and more importantly we should advocate safe research practices.   Also I commonly see people on this subreddit criticizing the rNootropics community which frankly I dont understand. I think that these two drug research communities would do well to work together  especially as nootropics could certainly help mitigate some of the nastier side effects of the chems found here.  Finally  I constantly see discussions over quality of product and every time its the same no one seems to ever test what theyve gotten. As a community wouldnt it be a simple solution for us to work together to try and get samples tested? Im sure having reports of quality would be a huge peace of mind for many and it would enlighten us on which vendors are actually taking care in their work. As far as I know its only  to have something analyzed by Energy Control. We could set up some sort of fund bitcoin? to have things sent there.  Oh and bitcoin.

It seems pretty retarded to have a headline like Markets Today Augur Maidsafe Remarkable but MoonCoin AweInspiring on a site named bitcoin.com.  To be clear   I support Bitcoin  and I consider most upgrades to Bitcoin to also be Bitcoin ie theyre not altcoins   I support simple amp safe onchain scaling for Bitcoin via a hardfork  I do not automatically support anybody simply because they happen to own some particular domain andor subreddit.  Roger Ver is simply giving ammunition to his critics by promoting altcoins on bitcoin.com. There are other places where that can be done. Presumably people who visit a site with the name bitcoin.com want to hear about Bitcoin  not altcoins.  This whole thing is getting rather tiresome.  I wish Greg unullc would just support a hardfork offering    MB directly onchain with no weird discounts   a fix to transaction malleability and quadratic computation time  This is certainly a sound approach from the point of view of technology and economics  and it would have massively positive results rallying the community together.  The wed have another few years of rising prices and adoption and wed be able to figure out some better longterm scaling solutions.

1294742,50.0,0,I went a year and a half ago when they were in default and the Peso was pegged artificially high with restrictions tariffs and taxes limiting access to foreign exchange. There was a parallel market that the government tacitly permitted with an exchange rate  weaker than the official rate.   Officially Buenos Aires was about as expensive as New York for many things but cheaper than Mexico for a variety of goods and services the government subsidised. I was able to quickly make a local friend something I recommend when visiting anywhere  its a valuable cultural exchange for both parties and gives you advantages normally out of reach for unfamiliar tourists and he gave me the location of a business that charged only a slight premium on the blue rate. Our party brought  cash that we were able to convert for ARS apiece when the official rate was . before hefty governmentenforced forex fees. At that rate it was straight up cheap there.  Ironically since the liberalization of the exchange rate the Peso has stabilized only slightly weaker  ARS despite the fact that prices have risen by about . Its not much cheaper today than it was when I went but theres no option to use the blue market for a more favorable rate.   I do recommend Argentina though. Buenos Aires is beautiful the food is terrific there are tons of cultural things to do and the Subte metro is fast cheap like . a trip and convenient for almost anywhere youd want to go as a tourist.   One caution is that petty crime and scams are common.  of us had a bag with valuables stolen. I lost a laptop and a prescription I would withdraw from if I went without and my friend lost EVERYTHING including his passport and wallet.  Acquiring my prescription was time consuming and difficult... I went to the emergency room with a police report but couldnt get the drug because they dont write prescriptions and didnt have the drug on hand to dispense since it was only used for smoking cessation there. I eventually got it by visiting  independent pharmacies showing my police report and begging for understanding my lack of prescription.  My friend was literally walking to a cab to get to the airport when it happened to him and the other friend and I had already left different airline miles.... He couldnt get any money or assistance with shelter and food through official channels including the US Embassy. No one would allow him to pick up money others  sent him without identification which had been stolen. I ended up using Bitcoin to get him  in Pesos thanks anonymous guy who literally delivered it and verified him by phone. That was enough to get him a temporary passport food and a place to sleep. The airline didnt charge for the changed flight and he got home the next day.  Edit I totally forgot about Igusz Falls.

1294756,25.0,0,Many flaws in your argument.    The strength of Bitcoin as a currency is exactly its deflationary nature.  Its the first time in human history that we have the technology to have a true deflationary currency and its totally untrue that this would not be a good property of a currency.   Deflationary currencies will still be spend but more thoughtful. Its the perfect answer on our throwaway culture. Inflationary currencies make companies produce meaningless products and makes people buy them.  Deflationary currencies make both companies and people more picky and choose on what to make and what to buy.  This is an important and necessary property for a sustaining future.  People have been brainwashed in schools to learn that inflation is good for the economy but these assumptions are all based on the assumption that all currencies are defacto inflationary. And are only in support for  of the possible conomical systems in this case capitalism.   Now that we have found the tehnology to have deflationary currencies this requires a whole new way of thinking which has not reached the books and lessons about economics. And which challenges our conventional thinking.   You have to think more openly and out of the box if you are going to take a look into the effects a deflationary currency would have. Of course it challenges the current form of capitalism which in itself is a result of inflationary currencies. But that does not prevent us from building a different type of capitalism that thrives with deflationary currencies.   For now deflationary currencies are great for preservig wealth and making the earths resources more valuable instead of a mustusequickly in the race against inflation.   Because inflation is a race it is exhausting our planet and leads to overconsumption.   If Ethereum ever wants to challenge Bitcoin as a currency it must become deflationary too.,2016-12-12T06:19:09.000Z,0.25

1294761,36.0,0,Good. Welcome back!  Now we have two altclients that both compete with each other and at the same time cooperate with each other Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic. It would be very good if Bitcoin XT would also adopt the Bitcoin Unlimited suggested way of handling the blocksize limit because then we and miners would have three altclients to choose from. If one of those three would start to misbehave like Bitcoin Core has been doing then the other two can take market share away from them until they stop misbehaving.   No altclient should have more than   of market share among miners and nodes so we avoid the   developer attack giving unreasonably much power to just one development team like we have today with Bitcoin Core. So when all three altclients are behaving like the economic majority wants them to then miners should try to mine on one third Bitcoin Unlimited one third on Bitcoin Classic and one third on Bitcoin XT.   So that leads me to the question for Bitcoin Classic. What is the default coinbase setting? Is it EBAD like with Bitcoin Unlimited or maybe EBAD like Viabtc has suggested?  I assume that Bitcoin Classic votes no for Segwit activation just like Bitcoin Unlimited does.  It would also be good for the safety of the network that no client has more than   of the altclient market share because if one client gets a bug it will be easy to very quickly change to one of the other two altclients that dont have the same bug so that the block generation doesnt get interrupted while the bug is being fixed.,2016-12-01T00:03:01.000Z,0.25

1294764,16.0,0,Good read.   The larger the dollar volume of digital coins in circulation the more liquid the currency and probably the more stable its exchange rate. This again favors established coins such as bitcoin and ether over startups. But more important if a digital coin were to reach critical mass it would become acceptable as a medium of exchange and a store of value in the economy at large and a big piece of its associated transaction coststhe cost of trading into and then out of the coinwould disappear  Why people shouldnt be doing ICOs on Ethereum. If you want to build a dApp raise money through donations like Mozilla and Wikipedia do and use ETH  smart contracts to power the dApp.   In permissionless chains the challenge is to formulate and execute a technology roadmap in the face of the conflicting priorities of opensource coders miners and commercial developers  Why Vlad an Vitaliks work on removing miner power from the system of governance is so crucial to the future of public blockchains.,2016-12-20T13:03:05.000Z,0.25

1294772,14.0,0,IIRC without giving any links to click.  There is a dispute going on that has been going on a good while now on how to handle the future of bitcoin. The current technology powering bitcoin is...well not quite enough for the current demands. Blocks are full  In a basic sense each block in the chain can only hold so much data. And every block is hitting that cap which causes slowdowns of the network but more importantly means that confirming a transaction takes a long time since the block fills up  The data each block can hold is just not enough to support Bitcoin. And of course in any internet community especially one that involves all the crazy shit bitcoin gets into no one agrees with oneanother. There are a lot of different solutions to this issue some believe in A some in B some in C etc.  So what about Core?  Well esentially the very big central Bitcoin developers work on the Bitcoin Core client and protocol. Bitcoin itself being open source is not limited to just one program. Bitcoin Core is just another program you can use to access the network. Much like any other large opensource project its very..hmm..closed in. Near cult like restricted etc. Anyone can contribute but you best know what you are doing. And those with actual write access to Bitcoin Core are supposedly Big Deal people.  While everyone involved in Bitcoin Core does not agree with each other there is general consesnsus among higher ups in what direction to go with Bitcoin Core.   Many people think Bitcoin Core ideas are shit other options should be used.    But wait ATF if Bitcoin Core is just a way to access the network why dont those people just use a different program!  Many do! But the issue with Bitcoin is that while there are many different Clients there is only one network. In order for the Network to go a certain way The Clients must agree well at least . Its complicated    The reason its really so coreanticore is because the Core team also controls things like bitcoin.org and for those who dont follow all this bullshit meta drama discussion probably dont even know such a discussion is happening. And since they probably go to official websites to get info and download clients of course Bitcoin Core would promote Bitcoin Core.    TLDR Engineers just cant ever fucking get along,2016-12-06T00:15:06.000Z,0.25
1294773,19.0,0,Monero is my current favourite cryptocurrency to possess. Its a really well developed coin with strong security by being conservative and focusing in doing some specific things right   Dynamic block size so no block size debate. If demand for transactions rises the block size will increase to satisfy the demand but with the beauty of punishing drastic increases by reducing the block reward to miners that start accepting too big blocks preventing centralization and letting average people to run full nodes to have high security and indirectly reducing inflation since the reward would be smaller  Privacy centric all transactions are enforced to have at least a minimum of obfuscation which you can rise optionally to very high levels. And the protocol keeps improving its privacy features with every new release  Blockchain auditability which means that although transactions are private and we cannot know how much Monero each account have we can be sure that no coins are being created by exploiting some vulnerability unlike Zcash where you cant be sure if someone is creating more coins in the shadows  Smooth supply each new mined block comes with a little smaller reward than the previous one. This leads to a more organic supply without the drama of reward halving inherent to cryptos like Bitcoin. Also Monero was designed to have a permanent but diminishing supply which means that Monero will always have an incentive to be mined avoiding another source of drama at the cheap cost of having a permanent but tiny and predictable inflation  ASICresistant mining algorithm to avoid mining centralization and increase the opportunity of anyone to participate in the mining process and no just a few conglomerates that are able to get cheap specialized hardware  Organic growth no premine.

1294782,20.0,0,Actual all time low of around . was reached in February . In August of  it looked like that low was on its way to be repeated. Forums were barraged with comments about Litecoins death. In November of  LTC reached its all time high. Fact is no one can predict next low or high.  As for what Litecoin has going for it heres my list   Capable of four times as many transactions as Bitcoin in a ten minute period. Frankly if payment processors had adopted Litecoin in the past year current Bitcoin block discussions would be irrelevant and likely the price of both coins higher. Anyone who has watched these discussions understands the immediate advantage of a network with larger transactional capability.     Faster confirmation times. The only people who dont think this is important have never spent a single coin or they have patience that the average person does not possess.   The faster block time of litecoin reduces the risk of double spending attacks.   Antispam.   Fast well established network. Current Hashrate is  GHs. Since scrypt is memory intensive it is known to be approximately  times slower hardware wise in comparison to SHA. Fair comparison to the Bitcoin network requires multiplying that hashrate by   THs. The fact is for most of Litecoins history the hashrate has been relatively high and secure. Those comparing it to the Bitcoin network without considering this k factor are either being disingenuous or just ignorant of the facts.

1294787,26.0,0,. BTC would be a roughly historically appropriate fee for a transaction that size. His one transaction was literally  of an entire block. My guess is the paper wallets had numerous smaller inputs specifically somewhere between  and  inputs.  This is a problem with Bitcoin thats baked into the protocol. If you set up a donation wallet even if its some dynamic wallet that changes address every time coins are received and you receive  donations of . BTC each... eventually you will have to move those coins to cash out. Doing so in one fell swoop will cost a fortune literally  times the normal transaction fee even if its only one wallet youre sending from.  Its very counterintuitive and bothersome but it plays right into Cores hands since it encourages only those transactions that involve large sums of money. Donation wallets? Spam.

If people stop using it for whatever reason Bitcoin stops holding value.  It will only appreciate in value over time if and only if demand for it outstrips supply of it constantly.  This has been true of literally zero commodities over the history of mankind and so Bitcoin would have to be a new and magically different form of commodity.  And as you pointed out its not.  Early adopters can make out like bandits but they have to bail out at an appropriate time.

1294810,57.0,0,My bank account costs me nothing.  Ive only payed one fee in over  years of banking and that was for converting USD to GBP for an overseas payment.  That fee was a few cents.  On top of that when I use my credit card I get paid for using it.  Ive never paid a cent to use it either.  Now when I started bitcoin if I wanted a transaction in the next block I included a fee.  If I didnt care if it took an extra block or  I could pay nothing.  Paying nothing was great for moving money from my hot wallet to cold storage.  Now it costs a high fee to basically move money from one pocket to another.  I need bitcoin on my phone to take with me and want to take it from my full node theres a fee.  I want to move it to my cold storage another fee.    Its become worse than banking.  My full node is full of transactions I cant move because they are all small mining payouts that will probably cost most of it to just move them anywhere.

1294813,21.0,0,Its so weird to see a post like this from the other side.  When I saw what you posted I immediately thought that you were a bigblocker and we were fighting against gregetc.  Because thats truly the way I and others in rbtc see it  were fighting against the evil corp who has taken over bitcoin.  Im just speaking for myself but Ive been a longtime bitcoin user since .  But what I see now is not what was envisioned from the original Bitcoin paper a peertopeer electronic cash system.  The refusal to allow for larger blocks just shows that bitcoin in its current state will NOT be used by the average person instead the average person will use services on top and it wont end up being much different from the current banking system.  Im not sure why the fact that blockstream is financed by large banks doesnt bother so many of you here.  Why would a large bank want Bitcoin to succeed?  It makes me immediately suspicious of the motivations of blockstream.  But beyond that blockstream only makes money if Bitcoin doesnt work as originally intended if they can get people to use their new service instead of the bitcoin blockchain itself.  Why doesnt that bother people that blockstream is so influential on the direction of development of bitcoin yet they have such a glaring conflict of interest when it comes to how bitcoin is used?  Of course they are going to claim that we cannot safely increase the blocksize because they only make money if we cant use bitcoin itself.  I dont like to call people shills or paid or whatever but it really confuses me that so many people just accept this company as being ok without questioning their actions or motivations.  And then theres the unsolved decentralized routing problem with LN that no one seems to have an answer for.  Finally the censorship on rbitcoin is pretty overthetop.  We cant even discuss alternatives without fear of getting banned.  Again this just makes me more suspicious of the motivations of those doing the censoring.  If the alternatives truly sucked why would we need to censor discussion of them?  Especially on a place like reddit?  Shouldnt those alternatives naturally fade away if they are terrible?  I dont know.  Im just an average guy who knows a decent amount about tech and computers.  But it seems to me like blockstream has essentially commandeered bitcoin.  It seems they are bent on neutering it by sticking with the low block size limit so that they can either keep it from being a real threat to banks or build their own banking service on top of bitcoin.,2016-12-05T20:03:59.000Z,0.25

Even after asking for photo identification I was struck by a rd charge back for . The hacker socially engineered the target to send their identification to them which they then sent to me on localbitcoins and make the payment to my bank account claiming it was some overdue bill or fine or something. Pretty difficult scam but theres an idiot born every minute i guess.. After the rd fraud incident and also depositing a lot of cash into my bank account over the counter  the bank shut down my accounts as a derisking measure.  Nothing ever happened past that but it was a pain in the ass and basically all my profits got wiped out by the chargebacks.  I didnt want to go through all that drama again just to make a couple hundred bucks a week so decided to stop it. Plus this was just before the recent peak so as that started i figured i was better off holding onto my bitcoin to profit that way.  c,2016-09-12T11:22:10.000Z,0.25

Theymos may do some bad things but we must not stoop to the even worse level of harassing the guy or condoning harassment in any way.    If we do that if we start doxing  we lose any moral authority to complain about censorship.  We become the problem.  We become those nasty people in rbtc who act in a hostile manner.  We become the bad guys.    We are not bad guys and we should not want to be bad guys.  We should continue to make it clear that our disagreement is a technical and philosophical one about the future of Bitcoin not a holy crusade against one person or company.    If we are going to win the block size war it must be with good ideas and solid arguments not by illegally attacking the people behind the opposition.    Besides who Theymos is doesnt much matter just as the real identity of Satoshi doesnt matter.  What matters for either of them is what they do online.    So lets stick to ideas and hope our ideas are better.  Thats what mature people do and its what we must do.,2016-12-07T10:04:01.000Z,0.25

1294839,16.0,0,Here is my opinion.  Im neither a savant or Warren Buffett.  The Euro experiment has failed.  Youth unemployment in Greece is over .  Italys banks have just received another bail out  NOTHING SINCE  HAS CHANGED.  Deutsch Bank and their derivative balance sheet is ridiculous enough to make Gods cry.  There is absolutely no sane person that could look at that and think there isnt a problem about to explode.    French elections come early in the year populist parties are on the rise.   Merkel has ruined not only German through her immigration policies but the rest of Europe through its monetary policies. Talk of  years lost growth in Italy and Greece why are they going to just sit there for those  and say this is fine????     We the U.K. have thankfully left the sinking ship once we trigger article  and start getting some favourable trade deals the smart countries will start to ask themselves what the great dream and the one currency is doing for them.   I would and relatively am in trading terms betting my left testicle on the Euro as a currency not being around in  years time.    As for the ETF if and thats still a big if however Trumps cabinet seem both favourable to Bitcoin and are technologically savvymost important thing here then institutional investors and old ladies who cant even internet can invest risk free into Bitcoin.   It will be the biggest moment in Bitcoins short history if it is approved and because we are dealing with an asset that cant be printed at whim or constructed on demand the higher the demand the higher the price.  More importantly if this were to happen the Morpheus quote comes applicable and we will soon stop worrying about how many dollars a bitcoin is worth but how many bits our weekly shopping will cost.,2016-12-31T17:31:17.000Z,0.25

No automod came into the activity today beyond him saying that they had to added automod rules to target me specifically mention of hashfaststaff after I expressed awe that hed even remotely think it was okay to call posting a chunk from the public bitcoin log doxing.

I agree that it would be completely silly for me to fuss about some automation gone wrong there. But it wasnt the case. I posted a commit message to defend against a pretty nasty allegation. My post was manually deleted and I was warned against doxing.  When I called a spade a spade I was told I frequently doxed people and the abuse of automod was revealed to which I replied that skepticism that calling out someone who name is long publicly knonw who ripped me and others off and who landed in court over it is not doxing... which resulted in me being banned.,2016-12-03T09:24:58.000Z,0.25

1294845,-15.0,0,You need to understand that if you add additional layers to bitcoin those are not separate things they are all part of the bitcoin ecosystem as a whole.  Its a union of a set!  So if you can do PP electronic cash on LN or a sidechain that still IS bitcoin if its exchanging the bitcoin token!  gtDo you realize what you are promoting?   Yes Im promoting expanding the bitcoin network to comprise multiple layers with each layer dedicated to specific use cases and markets rather than a one size fits all monolithic approach.  Frankly this is how scaling is done in most areas of computer science.  Lets say you have a network and that single dedicated server can support  people.  Now lets say you want to support  people.  You could buy a server that is twice as powerful as your old one and maybe that wold work.  But now lets say you want to support  people or x as many.  You cannot buy a server that is ten times more powerful than your original server that could support  people. That doesnt exist.  But what you can do is buy ten servers each of them supporting a  users apiece.  To the end user they have no ideas that they are talking to one of ten computers to gain access to your network.  Nor do they care.  Nor should they.  So yes I know exactly what Im promoting.  I have worked on server architecture for massively multiplayer online games and this is how we solve the scaling problem when we need to accommodate massively more people on the network.   gtIt seems you are ok with it that some special groups introduce intermediaries again .  No I am not.  I am in favor of expanding the bitcoin network to encompass more ways to onramp more people.  These additional network layers are not special groups or intermediaries.  These are still distributed peertopeer decentralized networks without any custodial control.,2016-12-06T00:11:21.000Z,0.25
