25,-6.0,0,First there is a concept of basic fairness. If one financial institution has to comply with regulation it doesnt make sense to me why Coinbase another financial institution wouldnt have to. At the very least I dont see how they could be subject to less regulation than a Forex trader.  Since were not going to completely deregulate the banking sector the societal will is not there then the other option is to regulate BTC similarly.  If you have issues work toward reforming FINRA.  If Bitcoin is not regulated then society will grow to realize that it does not comply with societys standards and then it risks eradication and outright criminalization. I would not be surprised if many people are arrested under FINRA one day regardless of warning or guidance from the SEC.  Is that what you want?  You speak of innovation but I dont really think of Bitcoin as particularly innovative. Its just a method of circumventing regulation but circumventing regulation is illegal and societally immoral. Circumventing regulation in any way other than modification of regulation through the democratic process is wrong.   As to your last topic about laws. Society need not prove laws work or not. Laws are created by society and whatever society agrees upon is morally correct no matter how arbitrary or capricious. You are of course welcome to leave society but you will be sent out on your back and also be forced to repay society for the education you have received and the head start in technology that education creates.  You have no personal or individual freedom. You only exist because of society. You only know how to speak because of society. Most of your knowledge other than basic experiences with the physical world comes from society.  When you speak of yourself outside of society you speak of nothing.,2014-02-06T16:37:42.000Z,0.25

29,19.0,0,Ive been pretty unhappy with tipcommit hitting Bitcoin core it pays people for making almost pointless strings changes broken into tons of tiny commits which add very little value and consume review cycles. ... and it pays them equally to people who make large important changes.  I am expecting that well eventually have an agument where someone is clearly demanding they get their trivial sidewaysmovement changes in so they an get paid and at that point Ill be asking tipcommit to remove Bitcoin core as well.  So you dont have to be ignorant about Bitcoin to find this sort of thing to be unwelcome just from a free software project stewardship angle. Or tax angle Taxes for the reciever of gifts in the US are straightforward theyre not taxed  U.S.C.  . But is tipcommit still a gift since you get paid per commit? quite possibly not.  And on top of this you have some unauditable centeralized service in other words hack pending collecting money on your projects behalf without your consent.. its just not awesome all around.

35,17.0,0,When posting nonEnglish articles please submit with an English title and a Google translation in the comments. Thanks.  gt ExGerman Bank chief economist warns of paper money and socialism lead to ruin  now threaten the bondage? gt Author editorial w o gt ..    views    druckversion gt  gt A new book could provide explosive. Posted it has Thomas Mayer exchief economist at Deutsche Bank. In this he is not only the banks to blame for the financial crisis on top of that he calls for an end of the paper money. A radical new financial order would her otherwise threatened the destruction of our prosperity. gt  gt We live in a time when a financial crisis the next hunt. Central banks print more and more money inflation rises. But through the many notes form price bubbles  bubbles that burst at some point. The result a serious crisis. The supposed solution more cheap money. And voil the vicious cycle begins again. gt  gt In his new book The New Rules of Money  Why we need monetary reform the Extop banker Thomas Mayer deals with exactly this devilish spiral and crisis calls for a radical new beginning. gt  gt Paper money and socialism lead to ruin gt  gt In his opinion our current paper money system is to blame for the misery. Or rather it is the central banks and banks that make more and more money out of nothing and so the stem a crisis so that they create another. This leads over time to a societys need for stability so Mayer in an interview with  Business Week . States would serve this need then by intervened in the economy and capitalism gradually transferred into a socialist economic system in this way. gt  gt And so we would according to Mayer exactly at that point or that ism the liberal economist has always been the fear teaches socialism. Mayer also can be the mantra  la Friedrich von Hayek not escape and speaks of socialism that destroyed the prosperity and inevitably leads to slavery. And because the paper money in turn is just the beginning socialism at the end of this fatal chain of causation is for Mayer clearly Because socialism leads to destruction is the credit system that promoted socialism dangerous. It is high time rumzureien the helm and to preserve us from destruction. Mayer has also directly ready for a proposed solution A new monetary system must be found. gt  gt Active money is credit money to replace gt  gt Mayer argues in favor of replacing the current credit money through active money. Active money? Money does not materialize in contrast to loan money through a debt ratio but is based on an asset says former chief economist at Deutsche Bank. The point of this money system The money can not be increased. Banks and States is that everyone access to the creation of new money withdrawn as  Der Spiegel notes . Instead the central bank in Mayers active monetary system the money directly to the citizens. Money that they do not any prints but produces public confidence in the money by. How this would work exactly it goes Mayer in the interview with the Business Week is not a closer. However it is essential that people between different currencies could choose. This competition of currencies would put any issuer such as the ECB limits and thus ensure that not too much money is spent. The radical liberalism of the Austrian School of Economics Greetings. gt  gt For the banks it gets back to basics gt  gt And the banks? The recall in this scenario back on their core tasks namely the securing of deposits and mediating between savers and investors. Where A business credit can only come about if all loans are fully cover through savings. For loans from which to draw nothing these times would be pass. gt  gt Bitcoin Euro instead? gt  gt So far so good. But how should this new active money actually look like? According to Mayer it may well also have a virtual character. Specifically he cites the example of Bitcoin. Raises the digital currency so soon from the Euro? Not necessarily. According to Mayer of the euro need not necessarily disappear especially since the active monetary system offering especially for the euro zone because it was working completely without a state. Mayers judgment Should the euro survive he must be repositioned as active money. As a passive money he is doomed to failure.  gt  gt If you believe his statements it is not just the euro but we are all doomed. Namely if we do not use the financial crisis as a chance of the century to replace our dysfunctional monetary system by a better one. Otherwise we will stagger from the financial crisis in the money crisis and destroy the foundations of our prosperity warns Mayer.,2014-10-25T11:06:11.000Z,0.25

37,352.0,0,No downvotes from me but you are being too impatient. You entered the market when it was rapidly going up and leaving it actually seems like dumping because it didnt sustain that pace.  Bitcoin just isnt the sort of investment you think it is. The key point of it all is you can actually do something to contribute which will make Bitcoin better all of which is supposed to be incentivized by your investment in it. This is another reason why interestingly Bitcoin will continue to preserve a core anarchistic audience because they are less likely to be affected by game theoretic dilemmas and divest.  Now what will happen is this sort of euphoric investors will leave price will suffer those who are interested in building up this system will remain and continue building it until people realize again that its not going away and euphorically invest again.

74,0.0,0,Satoshi could have the same effect on bitcoin by just shifting his coins about though.

75,0.0,1,You cant buy a Tesla with bitcoins either pal. You can find a company to sell your BTC to other people pay for the tesla in FIAT CASH and take a cut.   Find me a single car dealer in the US that will directly accept bitcoins youll have as much luck as you would trying to find one that directly accepts Peercoin or whatever. That doesnt change the fact that all cryptocurrencies function the same. If bitcoin never existed and Litecoin took its place you could accomplish the exact same things. Its inarguable that they are the same.   I never said supply and demand have no effect on liquidity. I said bitcoins for  was never a result of supply or demand it was pure speculative mania. A price down  from the all time high is essentially proof of that.

I own a MacBook for certain work and personal including application development. iMac iPad and iPhone S. Does that make me part of some sort of circle jerk problem? No I just had a android phone and didnt like it. Stereotyping a companys customers is wrong and doesnt help image.   One thing to notice would be that yes maybe android owners are the type that would like to be paid in Bitcoin for example. Again a generalisation thats complete rubbish. But if the tables were turned and say Microsoft was the same or Google even would it be the same sort of posts? Probably not it took a while for PC gamers or nerds to stop hating the company.

81,0.0,0,Daddy didnt fund business school  clever. Your argument will go a lot farther without the equivalent of a playground taunt. How about some evidence to back up your claim that Netflix gets  or near it beyond conjecture? If you have been to business school as if an MBA even warrants bragging rights anymore its the graduate equivalent of underwater basketweaving unless it comes from a small handful of schools I hope you learned that numbers and facts win arguments not semantics akin to businesses cut deals because theyre businesses and that is what businesses do!   Ill agree that whatever they pay its probably a very good rate so maybe even . is high. Doesnt really change the validity of my argument since whether it is  . or less I can guarantee it isnt as low as using Bitcoin as your payment system.  Also since all of my examples are USonly so long as being pedantic is en vogue unless you have insider information their most recent earnings call declared just under  million US subscribers.   And finally also forcing me to question what if anything you learned at business school you seem to believe that Netflix would get a large discount purely based on the fact that they lose nothing in the event of fraud  First I agree that they lose nothing but I expect the RIAA and MPAA might argue this point. Im not sure what Netflix thinks about piracy as far as whether they lost anything. I guess since they stream and it isnt pp they are out some fraction of a cent or perhaps a couple cents for the bandwidth through their peering agreements with CDNs etc. In any case they are out more than Disney is when something is watched via torrent without payment.   Second and this is really the crux of your cluelessness credit card companies almost always revert the payment and leave the cost to the merchant. Even when it is something physical reimbursement of merchants for the chargeback almost never happens. Visa et al refunds the customer pulls the funds back from the merchant and that is it. So that is good for Netflix and Bitcoin as it makes Bitcoins lack of chargebacks a negligible risk for their business model but it seems to have jack fucking shit to do arguments are more valid if we add fucking with whether a card company would offer a discount.   So what is your point exactly? And why are you replying to multiple comments by me in this comment tree with the exact same thing?,2014-01-06T02:25:43.000Z,0.25

93,0.0,0,Its a nice comment but there are some errors.   First of all yes without a doubt bitcoin is a currency right now. The bar is actually rather low for something qualifying as a currency. In prison cigarettes are a currency. Within a small group of people theres a common medium of exchange and this is undoubtedly true of bitcoin. Its a currency and the group of people which use it is growing.   Whether or not its money is a different squishier question and it depends on where you draw your lines. There is no objective definition for what is and is not money so lets not act like there is.  Second the old man as much as hes wrong does bring up good points. Hes asking the question must all blockchain activity in the future require Bitcoin? A valid question without a clear answer. After all there are hundreds of competing blockchains as I type this. So does it necessarily need to be tied to Bitcoin?

107,0.0,0,What Ive seen happen with Bitcoin may happen with Litecoin. The main issue with ASICs are institutional miners. They buy up a huge amount of hashing power build a facility to house their miners suck up a huge amount of electricity and then cash out virtual currency to pay the bills and make a profit. The only problem with this is it drives the price down as they are not holding. That said at some point it becomes not worth it to cash it out and they may decide to hold until the price gets high enough for them to cash out again. Unfortunately this means there is a ceiling on the price and the currency never really gets a chance to grow like it did historically. Also ASICs can centralize a large part of the coins hashing power making a  attack easier and more likely. The good parts about ASIC is it adds maturity to the network...its an evolution that any good coin will go through even coins with complex code like Darkcoin will eventually have ASIC technology but that will take several years.,2014-06-25T16:10:09.000Z,0.25
108,0.0,0,If I understand correctly your point is that a major exchange adds litecoin and reaps the rewards of added trading volume thus higher fee rakes off of those transactions.   Since exchanges are competitive with one another those exchanges that have yet to adopt LTC look on and feel a sort of business envy in the sense that other exchanges are profiting from LTC trading volume and they are not so they rush to implement it so that they can get a piece of the pie.  The only major player if they can still be considered major that has expressed interest in LTC has been Mt.Gox. I failed to come up with any evidence through google searches that Bitstamp and Coinbase have any plans to implement LTC anytime soon. Bitpay has come out and flat out rejected LTC.   The reality that I am seeing is that Gox is becoming a smaller and smaller player by the day. Their trade volume suffers the lack of liquidity has crippled its business and caused them to no longer be considered the defacto market for Bitcoin. If they do implement LTC it wont solve their liquidity problem. If Gox implements LTC will other exchanges look on with the business envy required to get them to take action? Is Gox still considered a competitive enough threat to even drive the other exchanges to take action?  BTCE is enjoying a ton of the volume trades in LTC and has a huge chunk of the overall crypto volume pie. Their volume share is larger than Mt.Gox. You would think that their lack of transparency would present an opportunity for other exchanges to jump in. Itd be easy to take over a very large chunk of the existing LTC trading volume from BTCE as simply marketing themselves as an exchange they can trust. But even this dangling carrot isnt enough to entice Bitstamp Coinbase et al. to adopt LTC.  Im just curious to see why you may think that Gox would be enough to trigger the business envy required to get everyone else to jump on board when BTCE has not.,2014-01-23T05:02:32.000Z,0.25

In practice other coins can come in and saturate the market. Bitcoin isnt unique or uncopiable. Also the number of coins is technically unlimited because of the divisibility thingy but instead of bitcoin going to the gazillions other coins will help to distribute the economic activity.

I had a pretty lengthy debate with a few people about how that hurts the image and brand of bitcoin and all cryptos for that matter. Their arguments were all assanine. They basically wanted to argue with me that they didnt need middle class America to adopt bitcoin to succeed and they would be just fine with their libertarian drugs are cool crowd.

145,1.0,0,Well thats certainly interesting but Im not too sure how it equates to a new system of governance  a plan after the fact  although some of the software could change the way we organize work and whatnot not sure I completely understand it not to mention transparency which should be very important in the future. It seems they wish to keep the old democratic system but integrate it more digitally although if technoanarchy is any clue for a system of governance Im not sure I agree with it. I would like to see a change in our current democratic system as well though.  The concept of liquid voting is also interesting but Im not sure how it would withstand abuse. I think the way to go on voting is a similar protocol to Bitcoin but it would likely need to be paired with another protocol for registering people. The concept of decentralization using network agreement and cryptography is more compelling and secure in my opinion.  Yet digital revolution aside we need a fallback system that at least works temporarily should a strong enough solar storm wipe out our electronics.  With regards to the article though I definitely think the US is due for a revolution. Its not clear if it would bring with it anything good however.,2014-08-04T13:35:46.000Z,0.25

191,1.0,0,I suppose my questionissue was really what does the ATO consider evidence because to me science background evidence is not necessarily the same as a record. One is fallible but one is not.  For example people in other comments say they will just use a energy meter on their rigs and could show the ATO their rigs current average reading. Well over a  year time frame Ive probably changed my setup  times. So it would never be possible to prove my energy readings during those existing configurations aside from keeping a spreadsheet of how it changed over time. I will start a spreadsheet to monitor the consumption of my mining rigs over time...  I would assume that mining would not be considered capital gains but if you are buying and selling coins like any commodity then Id assume capital gains would be most appropriate. I believe the ATO has addressed trading bitcoins before but not specifically mentioned mining. In any case I assume we could apply for a ruling.  It would be really great to find someone who can do my tax returns who does have some idea what bitcoin is. I loathe the idea of explaining it to someone whos never heard of it.,2014-02-25T04:23:35.000Z,0.0

197,1.0,0,Im not referring to any of his specific ideas in enacting change but more so his overall message that change is necessary. From the fact that we are pumping absolutely massive amounts of capital into financial and debt instruments backed by essentially nothing to the issues rampant in the legacy banking system.

198,1.0,0,Im interested too.  The way I imagine it is that users burn bitcoin to establish reputation thereby fixing a value to a certain reputation.

203,1.0,0,The number of satoshis in  bitcoin and the number of total bitcoins are indeed arbitrary.  So? They are the arbitrary numbers that we chose and the ones we continue to use.  You are trying to make the case for switching to a different arbitrary system instead of working with the already agreed upon arbitrary numbers. To me that is obviously worse than using SI notation with a bitcoin.  I have been giving you reasons why using a satoshi as the default unit is worse than using uB as the default unit not telling you why it is scientifically necessary to use SI notation or something. Its just easier this way.  You want to take  bitcoin and divide it by  million and then divide it by some other amount later or change what a satoshi means if we need to subdivide further.  I want to take  bitcoin and divide it by  once or twice every time we need to make it smaller  using the notations that have existed since the s. It extends forever cleanly and is compatible with already widely used notations both in the bitcoin community and elsewhere.  gt So one day I have one satoshi and the next day I have  satoshies because a layer of divisibility was added. Why would the base unit need to be referred to differently?  Well that would be horrible. Imagine if we decided to multiply the number of bitcoins you have by . I hope its obvious why this is a problem but I can start listing the reasons if you like. The main one is that it is extremely confusing to change what the unit of currency means.

216,1.0,0,You seem to have something against blockstream.  Look I agree that sidechains are no where close to fully baked but I dont see how an offramp to a competing currency via sidechains is any more dangerous to core bitcoin as if I had created NC TM as a true altcoin e.g. Ethereum.  The net of it is NC TM would have demand and people would sell bitcoin to fund purchase of NC TM.  This is no different from how Ethereum sold ether in return for BTC.  All of these things would impact the price of bitcoin negatively lower the economic incentive to mine bitcoin and have all of the other deleterious effects that brings with it.    I think sidechains with merged mining helps bitcoin.  I think sidechains with nonmerged mining is as damaging as an altcoin that doesnt use merged mining but I do not see how it is worse.  Maybe I dont get it but it just feels like a gimmick.  I think they are equally damaging.  If you can convince me otherwise please do.,2014-11-16T06:27:47.000Z,0.0

231,1.0,0,tldr Once you have your bitcoin you are free to do with it as you wish. We agree with your sentiment but also believe we can do more for bitcoin by not getting shut down.  More detail   For bitcoin to thrive we need bridges that move value from the centralized legacy system to the internet of value that we are all working hard to create. Bridges that touch the legacy system must unfortunately deal with a lot of complex regulations particularly in the U.S. These regs started out with good intentions consumer protection but now often do more to protect incumbents e.g. Western Union and reduce innovation weve spent as much time and resources on the law as our product. We would like nothing more than to get rid of all of it but we are just a few bitcoin enthusiasts and hiring a huge army of lobbyists is not something we can afford.  The U.S. government decides who we cannot do business with. You may find more detail here  code.,2014-12-06T18:58:16.000Z,0.25

233,1.0,0,Yes I read that article and it explains well why people will probably pull their money out of stocks and real estate. What Im saying is that    these things will still have value people will just have to be more careful with which stocks and which real estate they buy. I think that in the near future businesses will monetize by issuing reward points as cryptoequities and this will be the incentive for people to buy and hold. Youll need to be way more careful about which equities you invest in than currently but itll still be very profitable to pick the good ones early.

Yes. but wall street entities that cant invest in bitcoin due to regulations or whatever reason probably wont be able to invest in the ETF either.   Its purely convenience at this point. As a listed ETF buys can buy bitcoins using services like etrade. There is to my knowledge no real reason this ETF exists. Other ETF that tracks a basket provides value by doing the work of adjusting the  of the components and maintaining them to enable accurate tracking. this ETF is just  bitcoin.

248,1.0,1,Please read the PPC whitepaper  gt Another technical reason entails the use of centrally gt broadcasted checkpointing. In order gt to defend against a type of denialofservice attack coinstake gt kernel must be verified gt before a proofofstake block can be accepted into the loca gt l database block tree of each gt node. Due to Bitcoin nodes data model transaction index gt specifically a deadline of gt checkpointing is needed to ensure all nodes capability of gt verifying connection of each gt coinstake kernel before accepting a block into the block tree. gt Because of the above gt practical considerations we decided not to modify nodes gt data model but use central gt checkpointing instead.

249,1.0,1,I profoundly disagree. There can be an Exodus Block just as there was a Genesis Block. This is an extraordinary event and as humans we have the ability to deal with extraordianry events. We must not lose this ever.  Assuming this is the truth that the private key to goxs big vault is lost and that there was no massive hack it follows that it is possible for the network to allow its recovery as a matter of communitarian interest.  After all the network is designed to do what the community agrees it should do.  To the point An extraordinary transaction to an address under the control of a multistakeholder entity composed by impartial and trusted actors could be allowed through the consensus of miners and developers.  This entity could use mtgoxs records to return the coins to all verified gox customers in a process that could be designed to be as transparent as possible.  Something along this lines is worth discussing with the Foundation all visible members of the community and the community itself.  Leaving thousands of people in the cold on their own thousands of supporters with projects and the will to work to realise the potential of Bitcoin in the name of the dogma of irreversibility would be silly and borderline inhuman.  Bitcoin is what we as a community make it and given the extraordinary circumstances bringing those coins back to life through our consensus is the only reasonable thing to do.  There would be a lot of details to discuss technically socially and in terms of the actual logistics of such a process. But because it is not impossible we as a community can make it work.,2014-02-27T09:41:58.000Z,0.25

267,1.0,0,Its a metaphor. Let me explain.  Altcoins and sidechains offer features that the main Bitcoin chain doesnt have different confirmation time asset coloring DNS alternative in case of namecoin etc....  You have to pay to use altcoins features by buying an altcoin and risking to lose your investment the risk you are taking is a cost. potentially you may also be paying the developer who premined the chain. Also youre prisoner of the altcoin you cant cash out of the altcoin without renouncing to the features it offers.  This is similar to having to pay license fees with closed source software and vendor lock in preventing you to move to a competitor.  On the other side with sidechains you dont have to take exposure on anything else than BTC which is quite stable and safe. You know its not going to go to zero overnight its accepted in more and more places etc... So theres no cost in using the features side chains offer or lets say minimal cost. Also there no lockin. You can cash out of a sidechain specialized in micro payment and move your money to a side chain that offers a DNS replacement a namecoin equivalent. Thats full interoperability.,2014-04-11T15:48:19.000Z,0.25

Who loses money here?  Im gonna need you to map that out for me.  gt  As the price drops you basically start requiring people start supporting it at a loss as a charity  Again please map this out for me.  If you are only talking about exchanges then I could see more where you are coming from but bitcoin is mined so as long as the value of bitcoin is over the value of mining at least someone is making a gain without someone losing right?  gt bitcoin is enough of a cult that can go on for a while but not forever.  Well now youre just being snarky.  Can we talk srsly for a minute?  Im honestly curious why bitcoin is zero sum.  Are precious metals zero sum?  Also how are you tracking value?  If bitcoin rises in USD does that always imply that bitcoin got more valuable?  Or could it imply that USD became less valuable?,2014-03-22T03:58:01.000Z,0.25
272,1.0,0,Lol all of you that say bitcoin is dead are stupid.  Plain and simple.  Why is the bitcoin price down?  Simple supply and demand.  It amazes me how little each and everyone of you know about simple economics.    About  bitcoins are generated everyday which means that supply remain increases daily while demand remains the same or goes down.  This means a lower price.  Bitcoin is far too overpriced and has been since the bubble and if any of you are the least bit intelligent you would have realized it.  I love watching all these amatuer investors freak out.  A more realistic bitcoin price is in the s maybe even the hundreds.    Furthermore bitcoin has not lost its use.  You can still use it for the same purpose.  Its still bitcoin.

The surplus value your labor creates would be transferred to LARGE hoarders who would be happy to relend it back to you at interest. You would see your debts rise while your wages fell.  Im sure Roger Ver would be happy to hire you to wash his cars and sweep the floors of his house as repayment.  Bitcoin is no different then gold. The vast majority under the gold standard were impoverished while gold lenders reaped vast riches.

277,1.0,1,Youre right it either is or isnt a ponzi scheme and it isnt. But I would argue it is indeed more similar to ponzi schemes than bitcoin is. Fractional reserve banking is based on giving out more credits or funds than what you actually have to back it up. Every time you withdraw money its like theyre saying see you can always withdraw money so never mind that we dont actually have enough for everyone. That is similar to ponzi schemes which give some initial return to gain trust. There are also many differences. FRB is sustainable while ponzi schemes are not. Some may argue FRB is healthy though I would debate that while ponzi schemes are universally agreed to be malicious fraudulent schemes.  Bitcoin is nothing like either of these and it promises nothing more than the security of a notation in a ledger which represents nothing more than itself. It has more in common with gold than paperbased central bank issued currency and FRB systems.,2014-02-02T19:15:53.000Z,0.25

281,1.0,0,The line between asset and currency is a fine one and each has aspects of the other.  But generally speaking currencies are not volatile boring secure very low or negative rate of return and primarily used as a mechanism of buying and selling. They are a medium of exchange.  For example pretend for a second that you really truly used bitcoin as a currency and you have been doing so for a few years.  Imagine if you had signed a contract a few years ago with a landlord to rent an apartment for  BTC a month.  At the time that may have been equivalent to  dollars.  See how we already have to compare the exciting BTC to the boring old dollar?  Thats another good distinction of a currency vs. an asset.  You can see how the rapid spike in the value of BTC would quickly put you out on the street since  BTC now would be  dollars.  Depending on the terms and conditions of your rent agreement it may even bankrupt you.  Its clear that a business could never use BTC as a store of wealth because the rapid fluctuations in market value would leave them unable to know if theyll be millionaires at the end of the year or unable to pay this months rent.  The one thing that business hates more than anything is uncertainty.  Problems that are known can be planned for and overcome.     For BTC to become a currency it needs to be stable.  This is the exact reason the gold standard was abandoned in favor of paper money and its also the same reason that the Federal Reserve has inflation targets and spends inordinate amount of time monitoring the value of the dollar.  Markets want to know that a dollar is going to change very slowly and very predictably month to month year to year decade to decade.  Any type of fixedbased asset like gold or BTC hamstrings the ability to ensure this muchdesired predictability.,2014-03-10T20:38:34.000Z,0.25

286,1.0,0,Having spent a lot of time in Latin America its hard for me to think of this as the black market.  To me it was just common sense that youd change your money on the streets as opposed to in a bank because you get better exchange rate.    Now that I dont travel there as often I wouldnt go change money on the streets because its a little over my head.  Read Id be an easy mark to pass counterfeit bills off to.  Side note You state that Argentina doesnt have a problem with counterfeit bills.  I wonder if its because the inflation is so bad its literally not worth the paper its printed on even if its counterfeit.  In Peru its a rampant problem  Ive received a few counterfeit bills myself.  Just to be clear youre saying you havent seen an adoption of bitcoin in the black market yet?  To clarify this article is based on your own observations as you are in Argentina or are you using other sources?  I didnt see what your sources were for this article.    You mention more businesses adapting bitcoin per million compared to NYC  do you have examples of what kinds of businesses are accepting bitcoin?  If youre in Argentina itd be really cool to take a few pictures of businesses that accept bitcoin in Buenos Aires.  It might also be cool to explore how bitcoin impacts real estate purchases in Argentina.  I saw an episode of International House Hunters where an American couple was purchasing real estate in Argentina and they were very uncomfortable carrying that much cash with them.  It also presented a logistics problem since you cant enterleave a country with that much cash on you.  Id be interested to know if anyone has purchased property in btc in Argentina yet.  Are there any bitcoin meetups there?,2014-05-02T00:29:42.000Z,0.25
287,1.0,0,....and it never hit .  You act like bitcoin should reach a new all time high every day and then you claim youre right when it doesnt.  I dont understand how you can say bitcoin will crash to  and then claim you are right when it dipped to  and rebounded to .  YOU WERE WRONG!  In essence you could claim you are right as long as bitcoin doesnt hit a new all time high every day. Your logic is moronic.,2014-01-23T22:28:05.000Z,0.25
288,1.0,0,No I am saying one of your numbers is definitely wrong and the other two may be wrong but it is hard to tell.  There are any number of bitcoin startups that have raised funding but are not listed on the venture scanner site.  Thats because not all of them publicly announce their fundraising called stealth mode and others use angel investors or personal funds and just dont get recorded on that site.  So the total invested in bitcoin companies is comfortably larger than making that bomb of a movie.  To be basically right on the other points you need a plausible calculation for the number of bitcoin owners to be below . and  million.  You havent provided that.  Ive given data that can plausibly arrive at a higher or lower value so at best you are  right.,2014-08-11T18:08:34.000Z,0.25

299,1.0,0,You are being incoherent. The economy in general IS dollar economy. I understand that coming from bitcoin world where the phrase bitcoin economy is growing means something the phrase dollar economy isisnt growing does not mean anything.  Assuming you did mean to say economy isnt growing but dollar supply is growing then I disagree. Dollar supply IS growing but at the same time economy is growing too.  The money supply equationwhich was the work of Milton Friedman says that when money supply increases faster than the rate of growth of economy the prices go up. Or the difference of rate of increasedecrease of money supply and growth of economy is the rate of change of prices.,2014-12-10T17:33:16.000Z,0.25
300,1.0,0,There is a speculative aspect to mining but there are also a great many miners who have yet to get ROI. Even if they have broken even or better in USD terms they may be lamenting that they havent in BTC terms. So I think people will mine even at a slight loss with respect to just the electricity expense until they are made whole in BTC.   After that point strength of mining is more dependent on the price staying high. So far weve never had the chance to find out which you could consider as some sort of secondorder speculation. That is whether Bitcoin will prove its usefulness to humanity long term.  Bitcoins cost of production basically tracks its exchange rate so I wouldnt count on the cost to mine to support the price. Its going to be utility and scarcity that will be responsible for Bitcoins success or failure.,2014-08-09T02:02:34.000Z,0.25

304,1.0,0,gt The point is that past performance isnt.   Youre right.  Attempting to predict a future price based solely upon past price performance has been proven to be no different than selection through random chance.  But there are many other metrics to define performance and tons of more ways to estimate potential growth.   As long as the number of new bitcoin users continues to grow as well as the number of transactions and the rate of merchant adoption bitcoin will be fine.  And its price will follow suit.   Despite many comparisons between Bitcoin and M Bitcoins potential market is the worlds entire M monetary supply denominated in bitcoin.  At a current growth rate of about  that would take bitcoin about  years.  I have no doubt that  of people are not able to accept a change that radical over a period of time that short.  So I expect the growth curve to soften considerably.   But then again Ive been wrong many timesalmost always by underestimating peoples ability to accept change.,2014-08-31T07:19:59.000Z,0.25

Besides which its a solution in search of a problem. If they want to lock in the value then use a payment processor which handles automatic conversion. If they want to hold BTC instead do so.

Guess what if you cant secure your computer all your money will be gone before you can blink. And I have a strong feeling that the rAdviceAnimals crowd is not really security oriented and technical.  At this point you cant even _know_ if bitcoin will be around in  years. But you can still _use_ it. Even if bitcoin wont be around for long you can still buy stuff today. All this stock market talk of buyingholdingsellinginvesting looks idiotic to me but I dont care about money I care about learning stuff.

My actual password is not visible to the website because when I type in a password its sent to the secure website encrypted in some kind of hash format...  Like a signature to a Bitcoin node that confirms that I signed it.. But the node doesnt know my private key because the broadcast s my public key and thats how everyone knows its a legit signature.  Am I kinda close?  What I really want to know... If this is correct... If I use a hot wallet for casual use depositing and spending... If I spend too many times... Could someone calculate my private key?  Eventually Im guessing that many programs will start using new private keys for every transaction...

356,1.0,0,Gov has a lot of power. If youre coinbase its extremely profitable when you can get favorable legislation.  If were talking about coinbase generally a really interesting trend for me is that fewer and fewer people who use bitcoin are actually holding it. At the same time the comments above suggest that the hardcore community is slowly more interested in holding their coins themselves.  Companies like circle bitpay and coinbase... more and more theyre settling peoples accounts in USD and using Bitcoin in the middle.  This isnt a huge surprise but I think it will have an interesting effect over the coming years allowing the big money to secure a lot of bitcoin at a very reasonable price before wide adoption leads people to use bitcoin directly instead of as a proxy. For me this means bitcoin speculators need a really long term view.,2014-07-31T23:03:40.000Z,0.5

360,1.0,0,Well the problem here is that the HVAC industry is usually ran by stubborn owners who dont want to change anything at least in our market thats how it is and only will when they are required to.  I personally am weary of Bitcoin because of the following.  . Majority of our customers are older thus odds of having some ask is VERY low  . Not sure how we would tax it. I know the government hates Bitcoin because they cannot track it easily.  . The whole volatility of the currency and the whole security premise. I know the whole concept of how the currency works is secure at this point in time but the fact that some people use a third party service which is open to security problems.  . If we need to refund we always refund the same way they paid I wouldnt want to try to refund using bitcoin.   In summary I personally am happy we have support for Chip amp Pin systems before they are mainstream in the USA along with NFC thats progressive enough for me.

362,1.0,0,To put it in the simplest terms possible  from the point of view of a gateway currency exchanges just change who they owe money to just as simple payments do.  If I hold Bitcoins and I pay someone USD the following happens  The Bitcoin gateway owes the trader some Bitcoins instead of me.  The USD gateway owes the recipient some USD instead of the trader.  That assumes that there is a trader who holds USD at a gateway the recipient trusts and who is willing to trade them for Bitcoins I hold. If not the path may be more complex but the basic idea is the same.,2014-02-04T09:32:17.000Z,0.25

366,1.0,0,Actually I just PMd a guy here on Reddit about buying an Antminer S from him with Dogecoin. I can always mine Bitcoin and then take it to the market and get Doge for it.

367,1.0,0,Hey Apologies for the late reply. Pools such as coinsolver and other autoswitching pools are based on Scrypt mining. Whereby coins such as Litecoin Dogecoin and more are mine and instantly converted to bitcoin. AntMiner hardware is not suitable for Scrypt mining  so you will be unable to use these pools. Scrypt coins work of a differing algorithm to Bitcoin  and ASIC bitcoin hardware will not be suitable.,2014-08-20T14:18:48.000Z,0.25

369,1.0,0,gt Good for you. Credit cards are not frictionless for a large number of common transactions however.   The major friction in any transaction is the exposure of the transaction and both parties to theft.   And bitcoin is next to worthless in that regard. If the transaction is exploited via any number of attacks there is no recourse built in. And that shifts the costs of securing the transaction from the network eg a part of your . interchange fee directly to the user vis a vis the necessity to secure the private key.  Exactly how many people are willing to go through the process to do that? Does it occur to you that it might cost these people more than  of all their transaction volume just to secure their own bitcoin transactions in lost time for trainingsecurity upgrades? Does it occur to you that a . interchange might actually be a value added proposition?   Notice that Im not saying we cant trim the interchange fee. Surely there probably is some way to do it but what Im arguing is that from an economists standpoint that . should in an efficient market be awful damn close to covering just the actual costs associated with the transaction.,2014-12-05T20:20:29.000Z,0.25

372,1.0,0,gtIf the US Government did a git pull of the Bitcoin source modified it so that only the federal reserve banks could mine but anyone could host a nodedownload the transaction ledger and offered a fixed exchange rate that allowed you to exchange  BitDollar for  paper dollar or vice versa would you still support the technology as being a superior digital payment system?  I mean its not really a realistic scenario. Would the ledger still be public? How would you administer the money supply if it is only the fed who is mining? Would it be that you can only get these bit dollars by turning in your actual dollars for them? So you are proposing a dollarbacked crypto currency? I mean thats cool and all but its not really much different the  today which is largely digital.   I just dont understand how it would really work the whole point of mining is both to secure the network and distribute the currency if I am just exchanging my actual dollars for bit dollars I am putting faith in a central institution to manage the money supply and not abuse it...what is the point of that? Just doesnt sound all that different from our current system unless i am misunderstanding it.   Would the code be closed to the fed as well? I guess my grand answer is no absolutely not for many reasons. The greatness of bitcoin is that it is a basic protocol that anyone can add innovation over at the edges. I dont like bitcoin because of what it is today I like it because of the potential of what it can become in the future as tens of thousands of people are working on iton things as basic as making it secure and userfriendlyand as complex as new forms of finance and micropayments crowd funding etc.  So no definitely not.

386,1.0,0,Thats a good point have a beer on me! It was my mistake that I didnt set up my security question correctly. However this happened because security questions are often security hazards especially since you often have to choose from a range of questions other people might know of you. I know of many people who got accounts broken into because of those things. Thats why I picked a nonsensical answer many years ago when I set it up which I later forgot.  With Bitcoin I am very aware of the security features as I can choose the level of security I want. So on my phone I have  bucks in Bitcoin thats not protected with a password and easy to spend and lose. But with my phone I can also access a pass phrase protected webhosted wallet which I can use for larger amounts and I wont lose it even if my phone is brokenstolen.   Finally I have most of my Bitcoin stored in cold storage on an Armory wallet that has been created on a computer that has never been online. I have two paper printouts safely stored in different locations that can rebuild this wallet from scratch. This wallet is only crackable if someone finds those codes. I gave one to my brother to store so they can be accessed in the case of my death.  uchangetip,2014-06-07T20:39:02.000Z,0.25

391,1.0,0,Yes. Im more okay with copyright than patents but it still triggers two of my three tests for whether something is a bad idea. Those being   It interferes with the dissemination of truth  It is costly to enforce both in money and having a state or big corp. apparatus to monitor everything  see deep packet inspection etc.  An example of the first is that I cant say H.K. Rowling wrote a book it says ... even though thats the truth. And Im opposed to intent determines if something is a crime or not so the fact that Im speaking the truth is enough for me to consider it not a crime.  Another example of the first is if someone uploads a video of police brutality or something thats important for others to see and their happens to be a song playing on a boombox in the background then the owner of the song or even the cops can file a DCMA request to have the video taken down even though no ones going to listen to a shitty version of the song with words or someone getting beaten up over it instead of purchasing the song. It allows too much control over marginallyrelated items.  An example of the second is that someone can poison the well by uploading copyrighted material or worse CP into something like the bitcoin blockchain in an attempt to make it illegal. Such things only work when information itself can be illegal.  Another example of the second is that ISPs are policing for torrents. Once the structure and culture gets in place to spy on people it can easily lead to censorship.,2014-05-21T10:46:59.000Z,0.25

Not really an easy way to get that into cash unless you have a bank account somewhere but any kind of online donation system is going to require a bank account for getting cash in hand AFAIK. And if youre lucky maybe there are some places nearby that accept bitcoin directly.  Edit I guess with Bitcoin theres always the option of selling it for cash with someone local facetoface. I used to do that for cash on the side since inperson brokers can usually sell at a premium over the exchange price. LocalBitcoins.com is a good place for that and the Mycelium wallet on Android also has a builtin service that basically does the same thing.

I dont want to demean any other coins but theres probably only room for  or  in the public world at large and you dont see a lot of activity in the other coins.  The one making the most waves and the most accessible will rise to the top.  The amount of charity work and adoption in Dogecoin has far outpaced every coin except maybe Bitcoin and in a lot of ways we have surpassed milestones by the granddaddy coin itself.  The market is always fickle. We threw  coins at it and  or  stuck. One barks really loud. Thats us.,2014-02-16T20:48:32.000Z,0.25

There are literally millions of millionaires and that hasnt hurt the value of the dollar at all. And Bitcoin was far more unlikely to be what it is now five years ago. Ironically it was far more of a joke than dogecoin because no one could conceive of it and look where we are five years later. Dogecoin has come a very long way in less than a year.

440,1.0,0,Id say a majority of those downvotes are from people who just simply dont like dogecoin because its based on what a lot of people consider to be a very annoying meme Rather than the whole community being enveloped with jealousy  and implying such things like this thread does is only going to make things worse because we appear to be rubbing salt into a wound that doesnt exist.  I dont mean to burst anyones bubble puns intended but a larger trade volume really shouldnt be surprising when you look at the price differences involved and how doge is being used for a ton of smaller transactions. Gotta look at the differences in the market as well. Right now the dogecoin market is undergoing some pretty extreme changes whereas bitcoin is relatively stable so people arent going to be doing much with it right at this moment,2014-01-21T00:21:37.000Z,0.25

446,1.0,0,Fellow MBA owner here. Much recommend buying bitcoin coinbase.com? amp convert it to Doge over at Cryptsy or another exchange.  Coinbase will take  days unless you have a visa credit card which speeds things up debit wont work. Transferring the bitcoin to Cryptsy will take about an hour or two in the pending state before you can trade.,2014-01-29T05:30:44.000Z,0.25
447,1.0,0,In my opinion it is a good thing. Think about it this way since there will be around  Billion coins users of cryptocurrency will gravitate towards doge due to the fact that it is alot easier to deal with whole number than fractions aka . doge is easier to send than . btc etc.. We got a betterstronger community which is also a . But to answer your question as how is no cap better its quite simple since there is no cap on the coins it means it can be mined. Doesnt mean it WILL be mined afterall if its not worth it value wise people will not do it. But just the possibility that mining is possible will make people not hoard coins due to the fact that they will go down if everyone starts to hoard them like bitcoin is starting to do. Instead people will want to trade them often which brings more traffic which in turn makes doge more popular and wanted raising the value. Most currencys are made with no cap look at USD it has no cap theyre is more made each year.,2014-02-03T15:51:32.000Z,0.25
448,1.0,0,How can you say this while knowing about Bitcoin? People who invested back when it was just starting up are now filthy rich if they invested correctly. No this is not paper currency but its a currency nonetheless. Hell at one point even sheep chickens and cows were a form of currency. Everything is an investment in some sense of the word. Say you mine some Dogecoins wait a few months and then the price of DOGEBTC doubles if you sell at this rate that means you invested your Doge wisely and doubled your money. If you cant invest in Dogecoin or Bitcoin then you cant invest in stock either.,2014-01-05T06:07:38.000Z,0.25

455,1.0,0,gt probably not. is ASIC resistant marketable? nope but who gives a shit? securing the distribution of the coin is IMPORTANT.  distribution relative to what? if you have only a small percentage of a coins userbase  ie the miners receiving gaining possession of the coins then its inevitable that the distribution of coins is going to be highly centralized among only the miners. asic resistant coins will be less centralized compared to asic coins but still highly centralized in relation to the ratio of nonminers to miners. my point is that securing distribution by making sure its spread out among many people is not the end all and be all  just look at bitcoin for a perfect example of how a coin can be highly successful and be highly centralized. its not make or break. its a benefit but its not a mandatory requirement. if it were then bitcoin would be failing. thus vert has a benefit but its certainly not any guarantee or requirement for widespread adoption.,2014-03-29T05:38:27.000Z,0.25

457,1.0,0,This is dynamite Dognip sub second transaction times. I have pasted below the pompous conclusion of this verbose tome with my short translation below.  Please read my translation below trying to wade through the academic  corporate gobbledygook.     Conclusion. The proposed reengineering is much more complex than Satoshi Nakamotos Bitcoin. However the complexity of the proposed system offers compelling benefits  mainly the avoidance of thermodynamic effort which is currently  annual rate and growing an average x each year. Rewards are reallocated from proofofwork to the providers of decentralized network infrastructure and to stakeholders as dividends. The paidfor enterprise network design is scalable to handle all the worlds transactions.   Much of the complexity of the proposed system results from verifiable untrusted cooperation allowing commonsense teamwork to rationalize the routing of transactions to specialized peers and the synchronous maintenance of a replicated definite blockchain. As a result customers and merchants receive subsecond transaction acknowledgement.  The proposed Bitcoin system is to be deployed in early  as a hard fork of the blockchain within the Bitcoin network following a year of public system testing. Launch is conditioned on wide acceptance among Bitcoin users payment processors developers exchanges hosted and customeroperated wallet providers and the Bitcoin media.            Translation  The Bitcoin network currently requires  million to operate. This cost is escalating at ten times per year. The proposed solution is a hard fork to a PoS system in early  for testing of potential sub second transaction times. while still maintaining the current protocol. The changeover will occur once the community to accept it.,2014-05-26T01:35:16.000Z,0.25

461,1.0,0,Thats how every coin operates. Every block accepts a certain percentage of free transactions.   You have to remember this isnt new even bitcoin does it and always has.. We also want to be fair to the miners.  Likewise TX Fees will adjust and will lower in the future.  Though again we always allow the option of people compiling and changing the  lines of code to get around it. This is just to at least enforce the majority to abide by fees. When you think about it I myself see no reason. If you buy anything online or in person there is some sort of fee be it tax fees merchants have to pay or CC fees etc. We have chosen to keep them as low as possible but I do understand myself issues they may cause. So this is a Soft mandatory fee which can be removed with work.,2014-05-02T08:09:59.000Z,0.25

464,1.0,0,Estoy totalmente de acuerdo. Llevo unos meses minando y tradeando y por supuesto he ledo el manifiesto de Sakamoto que es el ideologo de la moneda. Esta claro que sin control no nos sirve pero la base tecnolgica si servira para hacer una nueva moneda trasparente. Quitemos lo malo de Bitcoin y quedemonos con lo bueno. Lo bueno es que todas las transacciones son publicas lo que pasa es que no sabes lo propietarios de esas cuentas. Si obligas a identificar cada una de ellas todos los movimientos son publicos y de paso puedes poner limites a cuantas personales  de forma que nunca puedan acumular mas de x riqueza y solo las estatales o unas especiales para grandes proyectos puedan superar un limite. Siempre se podra hacer semitransparente por el tema de la privacidad  transparentes para hacienda y annimas para el resto no autorizado.

511,2.0,0,You mean anonymity right?  Bitcoins can be traced through the Blockhain so I would call the bitcoin pseudoanonymous. People have bought alot of illegal things with it because of the pseudoanonymous nature of the cryptocoin but the same goes with fiat money though I agree that its easier and safer with bitcoins!. And the trust issue is pretty much solved as long as you deal with the currency online. The issue is when you deal offline.  The security issue is online though and thats the primary concern as I see it right now. A virus could potentially steal your Bitcoins. The workarounds is cold storage but then you would have to be quite techsavvy which makes the Bitcoins useless for the nontechsavvy people  and thats the issue. Its made to be the peoples coin but right now its the techsavvy peoples coin.  To say that the Bitcoin only helps to undermine power structures by making illegal activities more accessible is in my point of view misunderstood. I know thats what the news tells you but it also makes the banks less powerfull by not having fees on international transactions and withdrawals.  tldr I does make illegal activities more accesible but thats not the only thing that helps to undermine power structures.,2014-02-16T13:14:52.000Z,0.25
512,2.0,0,Keep in mind there is a difference between capital quantity of possessed resources and currency valueless trading convenience.  Money is often an umbrella term for both of these different concepts which makes for some vague debate.      gt I thought we could seek to decrease the usage of money and use it on less goods services. We could replace it with our own cryptocurrency or do away with it.      Absolutely.  By using the conventional dollar less we allow the owner of the currency feds and corporate to have less power.  It would be better to use local currency one which is owned democratically by communities.  Which is why you conclude   gt Communism but with money      Indeed.  More appropriately Communism but with currency although currency does not necessarily relate to capital such is the case with labour vouchers so no addendum to the conclusion is needed.      Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and litecoin indeed fulfill the role of adding competition to the market of currencies but it is still controlled nondemocratically by those who a have access to such technology of participating and moreso by b those who have access to powerful technology capable of creating their own money these individuals had benefited off of the capitalist system by acquiring profit in order to purchase these means.

514,2.0,0,Honestly looking at the free options riseup.net seems to be a strong one.   Theyre free they accept bitcoin accessible by free mail clients you can use POP to download your mail off their servers so they dont maintain a copy They strip your IP address from sent mail and server logs of which they maintain minimal logs and they use full disk encryption for their servers.  The only issue is that theyre based out of the US BUT Id posit that servers in the US are safer than outside of the US. There are no data retention requirements in the states and the laws governing monitoring of communication of americans are stronger than those governing monitoring of foreigners.  In theory if youre an american communicating with other americans your emails on riseup would be fairly secure from being spied upon.  ...in theory at least.,2014-05-25T23:10:06.000Z,0.25

You would have to be more specific but Im confident that Bitcoins incentive mechanisms tend to undermine aggressive attacks. I.e. it may be the first tool that absolutely trumps the state.  gt Can Bitcoin protect itself by freezing or going temporarily offline if attacks of that sort were detected? Can these attacks be detected even if not by a purely algorithmic mean?  Yes the network would quickly detect malicious nodes and should route around them.

528,2.0,0,Bitcoin is a ledger. No one says what they have to be worth. They are only worth as much as people find them useful.   Every one of these articles has to toss the term libertarian using it as a synonym for nutcase or fanatic but despite having a number of libertarians who favor it theres nothing in the code that says you have to use raw bitcoin as a means of buying things. The question is not can this technology be used as a normal currency? its how useful is this technology?  If Bitcoins flaw was stability then there are already derivative markets for example which guarantee you stability in the bitcoin price at virtually no cost to you. Problem solved.  I guess my point is Bitcoin does not have to work like other currencies because thanks to its digital decentralized nature it can be built on top of by anyone in any way they want.  The SPECULATORS! ITS ALL SPECULATORS! argument is the most absurd of all. Lets say our man Joe Nocera wants to start a new sandwich franchise and gets  million to start it. There are no restaurants yet.

533,2.0,0,there has been no hack on the bitcoin protocol.  the issue with blockchain was that they accidentally temporarily had a really bad random number generator.  part of the way you sign a bitcoin transaction and prove you own the funds involves doing some work on a random number and theres a neat trick in math where you can prove you did that work without revealing the number.  and that work involves mixing the random number with your private key so you also prove you own your private key.  however if that random number is revealed or if you use the same number twice and thus the output of the work you did with it is the same your private key can be revealed.  the R value is a number that is the result of the work on that secret random number which is called the K value.  blockchain accidentally picked nonrandom K values for a short time and people caught onto it by looking at the R values which are public.  that was a programming mistake on their part which caused the public signatures made when you made transactions on their website to basically give away the private keys since those signatures and the R value contained in the signature are public.  additionally that same bad programming was used to create new random private keys for new accounts for a short while and somebody guessed that that might have happened and started looking for guessable private keys based on that bad programming... and found some.  that is not a problem with the bitcoin core protocol.  the bitcoin core protocol specifies that that K value must be random and not reused and the vast majority of clients including electrum do it properly.  theres even a new standard called RFC that lays out a specific way to generate those random k values which can never be messed up so if you use that standardized way of generating them you will always have safe K and R values.  as far as i know electrum works properly and you are safe  although you are right to be concerned.  any fuck up by them or more likely by you can compromise your bitcoins.  bitcoin isnt ready for mass adoption yet because of that  the general public has never before needed to actually have good security.  youve always had your money held by a bank and your emails held by google and if your account gets hacked you could also scan your ID and theyd give access to it back to you.  but bitcoin is different  with bitcoin you are in complete control and if you dont secure them you have no one else to turn to if things go wrong.  there is no recourse if you fuck up.  if you dont know anything about computers or computer security you run an extremely high risk of one day losing your bitcoins and i would recommend to you to use third party wallet services like coinkite or coinbase or circle and make sure you only ever access them on your home computer not any public computers.  if you care about your self reliance id certainly recommend taking the time to learn enough about bitocin and security to be comfortable using it and id also recommend learning about PGP and Tor and other encryption tools.  these are things that can help you guarantee your rights.  but it may not be worth the effort to you.  plenty of people live very long and happy lives ceding control of themeselves to others.  thats not for me but its certainly easier and i understand the appeal.  and i genuinely feel bad that the tools to enable freedom and selfreliance arent safer and easier to use for nontechie people.  but sadly that is the state of things.  youll have to decide where your priorities lay and how much effort you want to put into the various measures that can help you.  i think learning to safely use bitcoin is worth the hassle.  you may disagree.,2014-12-22T01:27:05.000Z,0.25

542,2.0,0,gtOr in many cases because their ASICs are oneuse and lacks utility beyond the hashing subindustry this provides incentive to create altcoins to mine  I would dispute this.  Altcoins are on the way out.  I think as Bitcoin becomes more well established and the network effect continues to work altcoins will be viewed with greater and greater skepticism.  gtCurrently there are only . people who are funded and specifically paid by their organization to work solely on the Bitcoin protocol  The protocol itself is fine the way it is and could continue running for the next hundred years while providing a very valuable service.  Constant updates arent necessary nor are they particularly expensive.  The core devs also own many BTC and they will appreciate as the network is more widely used.  So they already have a financial incentive to see the project succeed.  gtThe issue as Vitalik Buterin and Sams have discussed is that Bob the miner collects the fees on the transaction of Bobs winning block but the costs of processing those transaction is incurred by the entire network as every node must verify every transaction tx.  Mr Buterin ignores the massive incentive for miners to cooperate and see the blockchain secured.  Incentives dont have to be direct  they can be indirect and just as effective.  gtIn addition these funds went to semiconductor designers not software developers or the actual ecosystem itself.  This is because software is cheap relative to hardware.  Sorry.  gtThis is intentionally hard coded but as noted above to increase the size would effectively lead to a variety of consequences such as centralizeation sic.  Satoshi foresaw greater centralization of mining and acknowledged it.  He rightfully didnt view it as a problem.  Notice however mining pools are actually rather diverse and decentralized now compared to the past  years.  We arent seeing the predicted trend toward greater centralization yet contrary to popular belief.  gtAdam Back and Austin Hill have proposed a method for capitalizing off this underutilized capacity via merged mining with sidechains in an upcoming venture involving several other core developers.  Im very excited about this and I think Adam Back is one of the smarted and most respectable people in Bitcoin today.,2014-07-05T19:35:50.000Z,0.25

549,2.0,0,One very clear claim this poster does make is that BTC is very undervalued right now. To the extent that one derives value from price this is not true at all.  The price is the price is the price. We get a fair bit of variance of course and the liquidity still isnt quite there which is the reason why. Day to day moves of  are still fairly common and they dont necessarily reflect a change in value.  Adoption in bitcoin can mean more than one thing. It can be adopted as a unit of account a store of value as teleporting magic money medium of exchange and as a precisely divisible asset down to  decimal places right now.  As a medium of exchange bitcoin is far more liquid than fiat and so any company like coinbase bitpay needs less of it to handle their operations especially if customers spend their BTC quickly with merchants which instantly convert into fiat. Handling all transactions in house is a lean operation.  This kind of adoption does not produce scarcity. Sure companies like coinbase hold lots of BTC in reserve but even this is being hedged to insulate themselves against losses due to price declines. So even as they build a reserve their perfectly balanced bets against BTC appreciation holds prices stable.,2014-08-25T12:29:19.000Z,0.25

566,2.0,0,Finally someone is thinking like I am. Ive watched coinmap grow from  Bitcoin listed businesses to the current  worldwide. Particuarly Ive been watching Colorado since recreational marijuana became legal Januaray .   As many of you may know legal marijuana dispenseries are not permitted to bank and therefore must remain a cash business. Such practices are foolhardy  sercurity is a burden in addition to ones own product. But billpay also present complications and the growing industry in legal pot merchs have been dismayed by this for a decade. In the same breath I will point out that it is in the Feds interest to keep dispenseries from banking because much of that cash is scooped up in raids of these legal establishments for breaking rules. These confiscations of cash are the cream of marijuana dispensery raiding. Aside from funding an entire department these monies find their way into many many pockets.  So it seems Bitcoin and Marijuana would help each other out greatly but a few things make Bitcoin and Legal marijuana wary of each other  . Silk Road  Boincoin community as a general rule run screaming from anything involving drugs  and at this point in the U.S.  marijuana is still just drugs. Until the Feds change the law.  . The U.S. Government Marijuana just coming off a  year prohibition is not racing to start handing out sales reciepts for all this legal pot even though they stand up and declare the right to sell marijuana legally they know in the back of their mind that its not legal in the eyes of the Feds. And  although the cryptocurrency is labeled as anonymous and untraceable it is not. It could certainly become admissable in a court of law.  But there are substantial rewards for the ones who do decide to implement Bitcoin with Marijuana sales for both Legal Marijuana and Bitcoin.  . Patientsrecreational users feel discomfort going to purchase in fact forcing your clientle to bring cash puts your clients at risk.  . Including cutting down on cash volume a dispensery could not only pay suppliers and payroll but a wallet can preserve a savings from the prying hands of a raid.  Bitcoin could use pins on coinmap but in addition to that every transaction is recorded into the block chain and the longer transaction history bitcoin has the more it will succeed.  Things to be concerned with when determining whether to accept Bitcoin for marijuana include  . Whether of not you can be construed as a money transmitter FinCEN is on an asspounding rampage  . Laundering laws with the DEA  . A payment system who is willing to business. Coinbase and Bitpay both have restrictions on controlled substances in TOS agreements. A pot raid and laundering charge could tie up bitcoin in a pay service much like Mt Gox  U.S. operations.  I for one would love to see a marraige between Bitcoin  Legal Pot they compliment each other and stand for the same principals.  As for Bitpay it would be interesting to see if they allow alcohol purchases or pharmacy prescriptions. There is no difference especially where the sick are concerned.,2014-01-25T00:31:47.000Z,0.25

589,2.0,0,Im just saying that theres no way in hell that governments werent going to try to shit all over Bitcoin. Its far too disruptive to ignore. It directly threatens monetary policy and has the potential to disrupt AML tracking which law enforcement relies on heavily for investigations.  People are arguing that we should be making the case for no regulation or at least keep the status quo which already provides enough regulation. I wish we could do that as well but we can see all kinds of forces lining up demanding that Bitcoin be heavily regulated  law enforcement banks and payment system reps opportunistic politicians etc. Theyre crying terrorism and child porn and using all the dirty tricks. It looks like a nasty fight is inevitable.  Allaire has the reputational chops to put a positive spin on Bitcoin and to steer the regulators away from effectively killing the bitcoinfiat interfaces. His motives are selfish but does that matter?   There really isnt any way they can coopt Bitcoin. Not where it matters anyway and thats at the protocol level. The reason is simple any changes they introduce into the protocol will be treated as damage and will be rejected. The blockchain that follows government rules will fork and will be ignored and its value will go to zero.   To me the main goal is to keep regulators at bay long enough to allow Bitcoin to monetize and for adoption to hit a critical mass. Once that happens years from now we can declare victory because the government will find itself on the outside looking in to a multitrillion dollar distributed global economy.,2014-01-30T22:33:02.000Z,0.25

613,2.0,1,I agree digital currency seems like it is here to stay. I dont understand the faith in litecoin though. A copy and paste of bitcoin with shorter transaction times and a different POW algorithm. Thats it. Why does this specific coin have a better shot than other and future cryptocurrencies?    The market value is starting to reflect that. You mention aurora coin as being one of the biggest pump and dumps of all time. That it was. Litecoin has been an EVEN more epic pump and dump feeding on all the newbies who felt they missed the Bitcoin bubble. From pennies to  or so. Id love to see merchant statistics on how much litecoin is actually used. I bet the sum of dollar transactions daily is only in the thousands of dollars. I have a feeling people use Dogecoin more!  Hope is not an investment strategy. Bitcoin was different because you were betting on the first of a new technology. Litecoin is a speculative coin that no one uses currently and the market value is starting to reflect that.  The strong network argument also makes no sense. A few ASIC manufacturers spent a few million dollars to develop some chips that could stripmine litecoin.

625,2.0,0,This is just my opinion but I really dont think price matters all that much relative to adoption.  The inherently great things built into bitcoin the ability to move money without expensive transaction fees the near realtime confirmation of the transaction it takes a bank  days to deposit a check still? and the fact that it is nearly impossible to counterfeit make it extremely tempting to pick up.  Say Im an ecommerce business and I know that if you are paying with a credit card my processor is taking like    cents every time.  I also probably need to wait  days for the deposit to actually take place and then I have to wait even longer for it to clear into the business bank account.  With bitcoin or any other crypto I can keep that transaction fee for myself or better yet pass it along to my usersconsumers and I can instantly use my crypto to buy something else without even needing to change it into fiat first.  So how relevant is it that bitcoin is like  or we right now?  Not that relevant because with these types of features whether its worth  or  as a business with the size of its marketcap being pretty healthy and the savings I get from the payment processors I am making MORE money.  Even if bitcoin were to fail  to a business owner the risk of trying it is pretty much nothing.,2014-02-03T07:32:22.000Z,0.0

I am not coming down either way on this topic but I had the same thought. I try as much as I can to be skeptical about the information Im presented with. We have no way of knowing whetherif Grams is telling the truth about the attack. It could be  made up. Its important to take nothing at face value or at least to know when you are taking something at face value that might not be true. There is a lot of value in asking What ulterior motive could someone have for presenting this information?  gt This means that Grams knows the DNM wallet of the vendor and the Coinbase address of this vendor.  I have seen you say this before and here is the part I dont get how does Grams or LE or anybody link the DNM wallet back to the vendor? Helix doesnt see a DNM wallet. All Helix sees is an inbound BitCoin address. That address could belong to anybodyand as I understand it marketplaces act as tumblers themselves because you dont own bitcoins in your wallet. You just carry a balance and when you cash out the marketplace moves some bitcoins from THEIR wallet to your destination address. So there is no single Bitcoin address that is associated with any single vendor on any particular marketplace. So I dont see any way that Grams could link a ClearNet address to a DNM vendor with any certainty.,2014-11-04T05:18:25.000Z,0.25

It was just as long with bitcoin.  I think we need to up the memory requirement of scrypt if not switch to a whole different proof of work altogether. Nothing will STOP ASICs from coming but we sure can do a lot to lessen the advantage they have over CPUs by increasing the memory requirements for a single hash.   Easy access to mining is in my opinion a core feature of DOGE and we shouldnt just accept that ASICs are coming and no one will be able to mine with their laptops anymore. Thats bullshit we can do something about it.   Memorycoin s proof of work algorithm only nets GPUs about a x increase over a nice CPU. Thats a damn good improvement over what DOGE has. Granted its not scrypt but my point is making it more GPUASIC resistant is possible.,2014-01-27T04:35:23.000Z,0.25
636,2.0,0,Its Satoshi who got sick of the Bitcoin speculators. He now reinvents himself as Hood and joins us Shibes in the spirit of unbridled altruism. Hes sitting on millions in several Bitcoin wallets exchanging some of them to Doge by pretending to be a whale. Little do those traders know that Satoshi is structuring transactions from BTC to DOGE eventually sapping away the richs BTV value. Satoshi wanted cryptos to be a force for good thats why he left bitcoin with many of the scandals happening and has decided to join us.  tldr  Hood is Satoshi.,2014-03-16T13:55:16.000Z,0.25

638,2.0,0,I dont believe this is a pump and dump or even that the price rise is surprising or unjustified. There is very little difference between the current generation of cyrptocurrencies and like ive always contended it will come down to which coin has the best marketingsales that will determine is acceptance. Dogecoin without question has the best community and thus has superior marketingsales and its price rise is not only justified but still well off where it should be. Why is litecoin a better store of value? Why is bitcoin better? The fact is they arent. Theyre not worse either they just dont have what dogecoin has. Andreas Antonopoulos says bitcoin is far superior because of the bitcoin platform but contends it isnt perfect by any means but sometimes ok technology is just good enough. Well perhaps the technology that is Dogecoins and its scypt platform is good enough. To suggest otherwise is contradictory. Bitcoin is great. Litecoin is great. Dogecoin is great. They all are and are all trying to achieve the same thing economic liberty. I hope they all do well and the people who are envious of dogecoins success are clearly in CCs for the wrong reason,2014-01-20T21:20:31.000Z,0.25

It can appeal to a lot more people because it is approachable and has a base of friendly users willing to explain the same stuff to newcomers over and over again.

642,2.0,0,Thanks for the very thorough writeup.  A couple outstanding questionsclarifications as someone who did not have the kneejerk reaction that this would be bad for dogecoin but is not entirely sure it would be good either  and as a holder of both dogecoin and litecoin    With a merge you can still just mine litecoin but cannot just mine dogecoin correct?  So this would require widespread adoption by pools of which there is little assurance.  For example most bitcoin pools Ive seen dont offer merged mining with namecoin even though namecoin is well known within the cryptocommunity and is really interesting in its own right.  I feel there would need to be stronger interest from the LTC community for the benefits of added hash power to prove true.    How would PPool work?  I know you said youd need to maintain both blockchains but dogecoin has lite wallets available so thats not strictly the case.  Also would there be a fork in the PPool with some nodes mining only litecoin and some both?  Thanks!,2014-04-10T12:52:57.000Z,0.25
643,2.0,0,I dont see why their cant be multiple cryptocurrencies there are multiple types of fiat dollars around the world.   But the real reason for the hate I think is pure greed.  People who got into Bitcoin early and have a lot of coin seem to think they are on the cusp of becoming the new banking elite the  and they are hateful towards ANYTHING that potentially steps in the way of that.  They may say they are fighting the man but really they want to become THE MAN themselves.  I hold bitcoin and dogecoin never spent more then I could afford and really never thought I would become rich from it.  If it all flops then I am ok with that.  Though I will admit that I am having a hell of a good time in the doge community  The moon is a big place enough room of lots of different coins.,2014-01-25T20:36:30.000Z,0.25
644,2.0,0,Theyll only mine Bitcoin or more specifically SHA. You wont be able to mine Doge with them.  IMO USB miners arent worth buying into at all. The hashrate you get off of them will never pay back your initial investment more so than any other type of ASIC.  For example the Gridseed ScryptSHA miner can mine KHs on Scrypt or .GHs on SHA. That Gridseed costs . Each USB miner there can do .GHs for  so to match the Gridseed youd be paying almost .  If you want to buy a small ASIC particularly for Scrypt mining the Gridseed Orb is the way to go. Dont expect to make a return on one of those any time soon either but USB miners are just a flat ripoff.,2014-05-31T04:27:56.000Z,0.25

659,3.0,0,Bitcoin enthusiast here gonna ELInotacomputerprogrammer.  . When you spend Bitcoin the transaction gets broadcast throughout the web to miners who are listening.  . The Bitcoin network makes a block of transactions and does some internal maths.  . The maths goes something like this. Add up all the coins that were spent in the block divide it by X. Then say this number has to be less than . Thats simplifying its harder than that  . The Bitcoin network gives the miners the equation without giving X and they have to solve it.  . Once they solved it all the transactions in the block becomes confirmed and the one who solved it get  Bitcoins.  . The Bitcoin network sees how long it took they aim for  minutes. If it took less then they make the equation harder more then they make it easier. Generally by adjusting the number   . Rinse and repeat  This system serves two purposes. Firstly it prevents people from double spending basically spending the same coins twice before the network has time to adjust the books. And secondly it makes an inventive for people to not break the system gotta lot of computing power? Instead of trying to hack Bitcoin just mine and make some cash.  The maths comes down to guess and checking to find X. So you can dedicate your computer to trying a few number when the answer is found you get Bitcoin equal to how much you helped out.

673,3.0,1,I agree with the sentiment but youre off on the economics of it. If you are collecting your wages in dollars and taking half of them and swapping into Bitcoin the price of Bitcoin will rise and the value of your Bitcoins will rise however the value of the dollars decline. So from a cash on hand standpoint you probably break even the amount you gain in Bitcoin you invested in is offset by the decline the value of your dollars. The problem is you signed a contract to trade your labor for a fixed dollar amount in the future which is rapidly declining in value as opposed to getting paid in Bitcoins. The real issue is that you are trading your labor for dollars. You go to work and get paid in dollars which decline in value as Bitcoin rises. So your employer would look at it and say Well I agreed to pay you  a year and dollars keep declining in value so I will raise the price of my end product to make more money since my labor expenses are fixed. So imagine if your boss decided to charge customers in Bitcoins he could then take the Bitcoins and sell them for the higher dollar value pay you back your fixed dollar wages and keep the profits. Imagine you worked for a grocery store. You would take your dollar paycheck go to buy groceries but it would all be priced in Bitcoin. You would now have to trade your dollars for Bitcoins at a significantly worse exchange than when you negotiated the labor contract. Very quickly gallon of milk will go from costing you  minutes of work to  hours of work.   So what you really are proposing is that Millenials decide that our value is in our productive capacity. We have the potential to be more efficient than any generation at any time in the history of mankind simply because of technology. We are more interconnected more tech savvy and have greater access to information than any group of human beings ever. We have the advantage that we can choose denominate this huge potential productivity in whatever currency we want Dollars Euros Yuan Gold or Bitcoins. The Dollar system allows the government to print new dollars and give them to the largest voting block which isnt Millenials so we shouldnt denominate our value in Dollars. Bitcoin is much more compelling. If our generation simply said we wont exchange our labor anything but Bitcoins then the game changes. If Mark Zuckerberg said you cant use Facebook unless you pay in Bitcoins people who wanted to use Facebook would have to acquire Bitcoins. If Sergie decided Google would do business in Bitcoins preferentially to local currencies that they have to deal with conversions and taxation then anyone using Google services would need Bitcoins. Now Facebook and Google dont operate in a vacuum they have to pay employees and suppliers most of whom do not accept Bitcoins so they would be forced to change back into dollars in order to pay wages and supplies. However if the majority of their operating costs are wages paid to young developers and those young developers accept Bitcoins as wages the game starts to change.  The biggest and fastest way for Millenials to flip the table would be for soldiers to decide they would rather get paid in Bitcoins not in dollars not in promised VA Benefits that never seem to materialize but in a digital currency that they control and can use to purchase what they want. At that point the older generation would have to decide to either pay in Bitcoins or go fight their own wars.  Now thats a rant.,2014-01-18T16:34:15.000Z,0.25

Bitcoin and other blockchains or blockchain technology in general are of course not the same.  The man in the video made claims to the effect that Bitcoin the blockchain that is currently called the bitcoin blockchain could be and would be useful only if we separated it from bitcoin the money.  This is a dangerous myth circulating that is all too well fueled by widely existing misconceptions within the bitcoin space.  Not only are these two things inseparable but even if by some twist of the nature of the universe they were separable the power and usefulness of blockchain technology though profoundly powerful in other ways besides money is massively diminished if we dont ever use this technology to free money from the state and decentralize it.  gtValue does not only come from the token of ownership.

690,3.0,0,gt You can always easily change the cryptographic algorithm for signing transactions in the bitcoin protocol  This is way oversimplified. Its not nearly this easy  to change the signing algorithm means not only that  every wallet implementation needs to be updated to the new algorithm  every miner and user of Bitcoin needs to update to an implementation that supports the new signing scheme and  every bitcoin address needs to be changed to reflect the new signing algorithm.  So no we cannot always easily change the signing algorithm. Its doable but it will cause a lot of friction as developers update their wallets and users generate allnew bitcoin addresses and stop using their ECDSA ones.  gt But you cannot change the mining algorithm in the bitcoin protocol  Changing the mining algorithm is very doable on the level of code  not that much harder than changing the signing scheme. The problem is that the change would need to be accepted by every user hard fork just like the signing algorithm change. Arguably miners would be less willing to change the mining algorithm because they are already heavily invested in hardware compared to the signing algorithm which they have no direct stake in. However this doesnt make changing the signing algorithm easy or the mining algorithm hard. Either could feasibly happen in the case of a broken algorithm and either would be far from frictionless.  EDIT Furthermore when ECDSAbreaking quantum computing is discovered it will most likely be by a private party who will keep the technology secret. This will give them the power to silently steal any amount of bitcoin from any previously spent from address they want all while the public still thinks that the technology hasnt been invented yet.

The internet is mostly Internet Cafes amp mobile data very few have DSL that is mostly businesses amp Internet Cafes. To be affordable pricing is further broken down into per day cheaper per service access only to facebook and social networks etc.  As I said people controlling their finances means that they can direct those finances to solve their pressing issues.

699,3.0,0,Theres no reason to increase the cap.  The need to print more money comes in part from a finitely divisible currency.  You can only split a dollar into so many pieces.  So eventually when theres not enough to go around you need more to keep the economy going.  This isnt the case with bitcoin.  Since its basically infinitely divisible when we need more we just alter the protocol to accept smaller divisions.  Scarcity is bitcoins biggest feature.  Its an amazing achievement to have a digital good that can only have a finite supply.  What other digital good has this feature without a central third party certifying it is so?  Removing this feature takes away the thing that IMO makes bitcoin so amazing as a technology.,2014-02-15T14:02:55.000Z,0.5

People would sell their bank books for pennies on the dollar to speculators who were betting that their particular bank was solvent.  In the end everyone lost.  If the zealots had paid any attention to the monetary theorists and economists who have seen these patterns before and warned people that bitcoin is a risky asset bubble and not a currency maybe this wouldnt have happened.  Oh no claimed the bitcoin faithful its different this time.  Well...  lesson learned.  Hopefully it didnt cost most people very much.,2014-02-20T16:08:37.000Z,0.25

708,3.0,0,If all of this effort and energy being spent on REACTING to those that might influence seated incumbent politicians negatively with respect to bitcoin ... were instead spent on supporting the candidates that ran for US House of Representatives and the Senate those that supported bitcoin in this recent  elections cycle we would have one or more allies seated in Congress that could respond to this on our behalf.  To be put in a REACTIVE posture to be made the fool is what the ZD Net writer wishes to accomplish and with  upvotes I can see the writer is having an excellent effect.  This is a lot of energy coming from a community that fashions itself as politically disengaged that has an elitist attitude when it comes to engaging politically. And dont deny it the anarchist and super libertarian mentality here is just an excuse not to engage politically.  BUT ... when there is a FIGHT and some screaming and whining and BITCHING to do oh boy all the sudden everybody is politically engaged when it is a REACTIVE response to threat against bitcoin.  To support political candidates that support bitcoin and see them into office would not that type of energy effort and expense be a better solution? Or is there no hope ... and only hope in screaming at the thick oak doors of the seats of power ... plebes upon the street rabble reacting viscerally?  Of all of the postings I made during this  midterm elections cycle in support of political candidates running for office this midterm elections cycle of all of them even those in support of Andrew Hemingway ...  It seems that NEGATIVE REACTIVE responses screaming at the oak door slammed in your face already seems to be much much more popular.  This is a silly game and has no effect except to make bitcoin supporters look ineffective and powerless in the eyes of those that make vote on and sign major legislation which will effect bitcoin regulation.  We can have politicians in office that support and champion bitcoin but without voting without supporting those politicians without making bitcoin politically sexy ... were fucked and all of you know that.  So lets all react and scream at the top of our lungs ... Were fucked were fucked WERE FUCKED ... and let the politicians hear how literally fucked you are by one single writer for one single publication.  REACT ... like puppets on their strings.  So go run and do your bitching and moaning and screaming if it makes you feel good but know that older people who support bitcoin see this as silly and most importantly reactive and when you are reactive those you react to are yanking firmly on your political gonads ... so you scream.,2014-11-27T02:42:33.000Z,0.25
709,3.0,0,gt However men and women browse different websites.   Isnt it because they have different interest?  Like they visit sites which cover finance and tech news less often... But that doesnt mean they are less interested in cryptocurrencies no thats different.  You seem to have a problem with logic reasoning.  gt Again Im not saying Females are less or more interested in Bitcoin than Males. Im saying there is not enough data yet to know. I felt you were making wild assumptions just like the guys described in the article appeared to be.  OK Ill explain. I follow multiple Bitcoinrelated mailing lists e.g. svbitcoin Im moderating a Bitcoinrelated Facebook page so I see who likes posts I constantly get linkedin invitations.  In all these cases I see first names of subscribers and almost all of them are male first names.  So there are definitely fewer females interested in Bitcoin unless there is some global conspiracy which doesnt allow females to subscribedpost to mailing lists like Facebook pages and so on.  Also argument about atmospherelack of interest in meetups doesnt apply here as these places are places for intelligent discussions or just sources of information and they arent in any way offensive to females.  Now its possible that the problem is in lack of exposure to the idea but I dont buy that argument as in this day and age everybody has same access to same sources of information and filters it _according to his interests_.,2014-01-24T22:35:27.000Z,0.25

An unscrupulous wallet generator. A Java applet that ran with unrestricted permissions and stole a wallet.  I have yet to see a reported case of someone losing bitcoin due to using bitaddress on a temporarily disconnected computer. I would be interested in knowing about a documented case though.

If your deposits are insured they are certainly paying premiums out the ass for that.  Most real banks dont make money on their fees they make money from lending and collecting interest on collateralized debt.  Does this Bitcoin bank perform that function?

736,3.0,0,I can definitely see some utility in international money transfers for those who are technical enough.  Bitcoin or something similar could carve a niche in that area but it would certainly be a riskier transfer than going through an institution.  I know that I would rather pay the fee than float a large amount of money into the market and pull it out on the other side.  Im not so sure I buy the goldsilver bug argument as much.  If it was possible to tie or back a cryptocurrency with gold I think it would really take off essentially turning it into a gold ETF that can be used for transactions.  As of now though Bitcoin really shares no similarities with gold other than the fact that there is a finite amount.  Gold derives its value from truly universal acceptance and for lack of a better term its historical credibility in addition to its scarcity.  Bitcoin doesnt have either of the first two right now.  As far as the antibank people... I would say thats a case of cutting off your nose to spite your face.  Sure maybe you can make some money off of price appreciation of bitcoin but you are losing all security and as I mentioned before taking a huge market risk by not keeping your money at a bank.  I just dont think too many prudent people are going to pull money out of an insured product keep in mind FDIC insurance is paid for by the banks into what is called the DIF to pay depositors out in the event of a failure and is not paid for by the US govt to hold it themselves.  Just my two cents.  Not trying to pick a fight.  I just am obviously not able to justify the risk.,2014-06-05T18:08:16.000Z,0.25

741,3.0,0,You have given this way too little thought. Sure bitcoin is not ready for the average consumer but these types of problems you mention are just holes for entrepeneurs to step in before btc is mainstream.   Its about the protocol like email or tcpip or whatever. The internet in  was not accesible at all to the average consumer text based software like gopher was the most used interface you had to dial in with your phone and set up a complicated subscription so it took entrepeneurs to start up browsers like explorer and netscape navigator to make it easier for the average consumer to access its possibilities. Eventually facebook youtube myspace and the sorts started the Web .. It sounds new but these were all built on top of the same protocol.  This bitcoin protocol is what people are hyping. Part speculation and part believers in the protocol. I think youll find a lot of speculation in this sub thats not criticism btw its just the point of this sub.

742,3.0,0,If you want to have a portion of your portfolio in bitcoin but dont want to have to play the market or you just hate trading in general there is absolutely nothing wrong with dollar cost averaging. Of course you can potentially make more money by doing successful trades. No fucking shit. You can also lose more money if you do a lot of bad trades than had you just dollar cost averaged with a set plan rather than gamble like a maniac.  Dollar cost averaging or buying once and holding is for people who want to take the leap into bitcoin and dont want to actively trade seeing where things go in the long term. So many people in this subreddit seem to hate that notion. Yes if you DCAd all of  youre down year over year. It was a bad year for bitcoin. Could anyone have known just how bad it was gonna be with absolute certainty? If I had a crystal ball I wouldnt need to dollar cost average. But the reality is if I want to make good trades I need to put a lot of work and research into it and actively manage things. Thats a fucking job. Some people are busy with life and dont have time for that or they just dont enjoy trading and would rather not do it. But they still think bitcoin is awesome and going to be really big in the future. So DCA is a less risky and a super easy discipline to get a person to put a portion of their portfolio into bitcoin.  Imagine if th of the worlds population did this.  million people put like  bucks into bitcoin every week like its a bankless longterm savings account. A bunch of people treating bitcoin like this ends up making it way more valuable and theres not a ton of risk. There are way worse things people could be putting those  into.,2014-12-11T17:55:24.000Z,0.25

If all were new Bitcoin users it would be neutral to the price of Bitcoin.  Any existing users at the present time create new selling volume.

751,3.0,0,Youre absolutely right in the sense that it is impossible to tell how things will end up exactly. But what you can say with certainty is that batches of smaller miners will be replaced by a single more efficient miner. Basically larger scale means more efficiency economies of scale hence the profitability of less efficient miners small scale will drop below zero and they will be pushed away. As efficiency and scale go up the network will thus end up less distributed.  How this will exactly translate to the numbers no clue. But sooner or later it seems inevitable that the majority of the network must hand up in the hands of a single group. But thats the case for all common proof of work algos also Bitcoin and later could mean a year to another decade or so. For Scrypt coins this is an interesting time because a huge batch is unloaded on the network at the same time I dont think weve seen this in terms of size before and plain uncertainty about how this will impact it can already do a lot of damage I guess.,2014-07-05T12:44:22.000Z,0.25
752,3.0,0,I find the bitcoin obsession with traditional retail and banking to be incredibly short sighted.  Even if digital currencies represented a significant improvement over traditional retail payment methods which they dont the vested interests will always have the upper hand.  It is far better and far more interesting to build a community of people who want to actively participate not just serve as a dumping ground for your coins.  I want to give my coins to shibes that produce music stories and videos and to shibes that provide services for other shibes.  I dont want to give my dogecoins to A N Other restaurant just for them to immediately convert them to fiat.,2014-04-29T11:08:48.000Z,0.5

The prius is a more efficient system but less economical  cost effective.  This entire discussion was on the fact that running a computer to mine bitcoins will heat a room equally as well as a space heater.  They use the exact same amount of fuel energy when they run and produce the exact same amount of heat.  If your goal is to heat a house you can substitute space heaters for bitcoin miners and not worry about the extra expense incurred because the side effect of what they do producing heat costs the same as operating a space heater and has the same effect.,2014-03-06T19:11:08.000Z,0.25
759,4.0,0,I agree. Its a PR campaign and everyone is an agent. Most people who are even aware of it got their information from a MSN source like CNN that publishes stupid statements such as CEO of Bitcoin. They dont know any better. Some are willfully ignorant and speak loudly and confidently without knowing what they are talking about. However getting into spats with these people no matter how unnerved we are by the stupid things they say makes us look equally foolish to onlookers.    Thankfully Ive seen many instances of people in this community handling these people very well and even using their personal wealth to educate. That redittor who gave away . BTC on the WoW forums was patient and engaged all people with rational responses that werent emotionally charged. We would all do Bitcoin a service by behaving in a similar fashion. We can be the teachers. What student ever learned much or was inspired to learn much by a teacher who scoffed whenever a student admitted to not knowing the new material?

763,4.0,0,Simply put the US has no fast payment network and US banks arent looking to innovate around that. ACH is slow and thats the Feds job to fix. Credit card use in the US is high and banks make a huge amount of profit off of credit card transactions. When you pay by credit card  groups take a cut. The card issuer the payment network eg. Visa and the payment processor. Thats a hugely profitable business for banks.   Now this compares to a country like Canada where EFT is just as slow as ACH.  However Canadian banks did something different. They innovated around the slow bank transfer infrastructure and created a new network Interac that benefits consumers and allows for a not for profit debit card network which is instant and has network fee lower than Bitcoin then in addition to that created email money transfers that allow anyone to send and receive money from any bankcredit union in the country near instantly though an email and then Interac Online of which Bitcoin exchanges love as it allows for instant deposits. Sadly Interac Online isnt supported by most banks but the email transfers and debit card network is supported by all banks and CUs.   The not for profit Interac debit network was wide spread before the other innovations and Canadians are actively encouraged through advertising to use their Interac debit card and spend their own money rather than borrow with credit. So banks arent as driven by profit for the stock holder in respect to credit cards but instead they did something that benefits the consumer as the consumer wasnt going to use the credit card anyways. American banks are to driven by the momentum and profit of credit card use and even debit card use in the US which is also Visa and what not unlike Canada to go ahead and innovate around the problem and create a system that subverts the slow and expensive credit card network. Instead America is relies on the Fed to update ACH and banks have no motivation to create a work around.  At least thats my interpretation.,2014-10-14T18:49:19.000Z,0.25

766,4.0,0,well a  attack doesnt necessarily fork the chain.  if the attacker is following all the rules theres no fork happening unless everybody agrees to blockinvalidate some valid transactions that are known to be the attackers.  the danger of a  attack is that an attacker can secretly mine without publishing his blocks and hell be building up a longer valid blockchain and then he goes and buys stuff and the site waits for confirmations and then after the transaction is all complete he then publishes his longer chain remember the longest is the real one so his new chain becomes the real one and that chain doesnt have that transaction so he has in effect reversed a tx with many confirmations.  an attacker can also slow down confirmations by just mining blocks with no tx in them so the other  are the only ones putting txs in blocks.  basically a  attack isnt the end of the world but it means you should wait longer for confirmations at least  because i think the current protocol generates an error if a new longest chain that undoes  blocks randomly appears and it could slow down confirmations.  in short it would cripple but not kill bitcoin and cause a price crash.  but none of that has to do with a fork.  the real reason though that a  attack isnt likely from nationstate level actors is because a far better use of funds would be to simply manipulate the market and cause continual giant price crashes so that adoption remains low.  dollar for dollar thats way more effective at shutting down bitcoin than  attacking it.  also notice how neither attack actually kills bitcoin.  thats one of the beauties of bitcoin.  it literally cannot be stopped.  it can only be wounded and as soon as you stop the wounding it picks right back up where it left off and keeps on trucking.,2014-05-28T15:01:57.000Z,0.25

770,4.0,0,We give free stickers to our users in order to promote our brand. We think it goes a longer way than paying for clicks on ads nobody wants to see.  Anyway... in order to give more stickers when we are low on cash we ask users to pay for the postage .  For those of you who dont have your own business yet this is what a chargeback means.  You try to charge your customer even a little amount of . to cover for postage but if the customer decides to file a chargeback say the credit card data was stolen like what happene on Target and being tested by online thieves massively in order to resell it the business ends up losing  for each one of these chargebacks and theyre very hard to dispute.   Even though it was really the fault of the credit card institution for not having tighter security the seller takes all the risk and costs of the dispute. This is by far one of the best selling points of Bitcoins and why I think eCommece adoption will be faster than a lot of people think with the additional upside that it will enable a whole new economy of micropayments.

773,4.0,0,You are severely confused which I concede is at least partially my fault but youve been negative from the start so I dont have much sympathy for your condensation condescension.   gt Hell you even bragged about the whole purchase cycle through Coinbase and Bitpay being faster than the phone call which you could have also done when you paid Namecheap.... but you didnt.  gt So... that would be the fail.  There are two distinct namecheap transactions. The first transaction occurred a week ago and is the one I referenced in the post itself. This was one of the transactions that was listed when I was verifying my recent transactions. This was made by credit card for a whole host of reasons that Ive already explained. This charge went through no problem.  Then yesterday there was a second namecheap transaction this was the one discussed in my comment. I tried to pay with credit card and had it declined. It is at this point in which I have to purchase bitcoin because I dont have enough in my wallet to cover the purchase price and then make the payment to namecheap with bitcoin.  So to your last line I have no idea what you think I did or didnt do but where you say you didnt what really happened was I did just that. I did do that when I payed namecheap.  And my bragging was merely about the fact that with bitcoin even the hoops I had to jump through in this case was quicker than having to deal with my bank. How that is even remotely a fail just does not make even a bit of sense.,2014-09-07T00:12:07.000Z,0.25

789,4.0,0,How is this  hopefully clear enough for an intelligent investor?   The specialised and very expensive hardware coming out for mining coins ASICs means that the production of coins and the tracking of our transactions will become more and more limited to a small number of specialised corporate entities. This will give these entities significant power over cryptocurrencies for example determining transaction fees and anonymity which represents a clear departure from the original concept of crypto as currency that is out of the hands of government and corporate entities.  Almost all coins will become minable by ASICS in the coming months. This makes Vertcoin truly a standout coin that addresses clear and present concerns. While we do not know how the the rollout of ASICs will play out Vertcoin offers a strong hedge against potential problems that retains the original spirit of BitCoin.

800,5.0,0,This is the case with the majority of physical commodities.  If cost to produce is more than cost to purchase commodity is purchased instead of produced and vice versa. Eventually equilibrium will be reached. As markets become more mature there is much more consistency around the equilibrium level. As bitcoin is in its infancy one should expect hype cycles and long lulls where the pricecost equilibrium is found  until the asset is mature enough that price will oscillate around the equilibrium point in a much lower bound.  You see this happen in commodity mining when demand wanes the largest miners with the biggest cash reserves withhold supply in hopes to pull the market price back up to the marginal cost to produce mark.  You are correct bitcoin is most definitely not different.,2014-08-01T14:04:46.000Z,0.25
801,5.0,0,gt I should have foreseen this but did anyone consider buying dogecoins last week? Here I was talking about the car and how it was a great marketing tool but I never made the connection to prices. Theres an argument to be made that the price of dogecoins is going to rise after that especially given that the commentators talked about the car and how he was holding in fourth position for a while.  I have had dogecoins for a while and banked on the halving a week ago and the dogecar having some effect on the market but so far its been nothing worth noting. It seems like the pump the week earlier was it and now Im left with those coins more jaded each day. The shenanigans around dogecoin are well worth the time its a lovely community.  Meanwhile other alts have exploded in value left right and center. Its really quite frustrating. I completely reserve judgement on any rise in alts because Ive seen random coins being pumped and dumped all the time with no really reason behind it. And yet the coin that actually had its mining supply cut in half and put a guy in a race does nothing on the market. Who the fuck knows anything about the  alts who isnt a frequent visitor of bitcointalk coinmarketcap and cryptsybtermoolah? I guarantee you if you asked a random person on the street about cryptocurrencies youll probably hear bitcoin litecoin dogecoin and maybe darkcoin because of the recent buzz.  Anyway whats interesting to me as Ive followed dogecoin closely over the last couple of weeks is how utterly dependent on the bitcoin price movement it is at the moment. Its really strange. Back in JanuaryFebruaryMarch theres been quite the independent swings in DOGEBTC value it jumped up and down irrespective of what bitcoin was doing. Yet end of March or so onwards its following the BTC trend closely. Seriously just have a look at bitcoinwisdom for cryptsy DOGEBTC and Bitstamp BTCUSD and compare the two. From March th or so onwards the DOGE graph is starting to mirror the BTC graph more and more in terms of relative movement and now its virtually identical.  What does that mean? The only thing I can think of is that the uncertainty and massive bearish sentiment of Bitcoin is affecting the other coins and holding up any significant upwards movement. Im certain that a significant upwards breakout in Bitcoin will make the altcoin value skyrocket but so far were still up shit river with barely an end in sight.,2014-05-05T14:25:53.000Z,0.25

805,6.0,0,The osmotic strategy for libertarian change asserts that we dont need people to embrace ancap ideas at all we only need to get them to embrace ancap modes of living and they will intuit  absorb the rest in time.  This means building ancap governance services things like bitcoin private law police courts and ancap regions that are attractive to nonancaps because they offer good wages and opportunity.  In the same way that you dont need a degree in finance to use a bank you wont need to know ancap theory to use ancap services just like at least half of the people using bitcoin arent ancap.   We simply outcompete state services with better alternatives.  And it will always be possible to do so because state services are ipso facto exploitative whereas our alternatives are not.  The dollar will always be inflationarybitcoin is not. Etc.  We can through seasteading have our own libertarian region within the end of this decade and have people living there who arent ancap within the next decade easily.   years.,2014-03-22T04:32:01.000Z,0.25

On the other hand it is successfully being used as a payment network for a variety of different usecases.  It has its strengths and weaknesses as a payment network and about to be outdone in some ways by its own payment revolution that it has arguably kickedoff. . . apple paypal google CCs etc. but it is not even debatable whether it is currently acting as a payment network.

816,6.0,0,As long as we dont develop methods that will make running completely transparent businesses very easy and therefore the norm for Bitcoin based ones we will have to rely too heavily on personal integrity. I understand that NeoampBee investors were too optimistic and applied too little scrutiny but I also dont think this is a very exceptional case of an investment going bad.  The easiest model is designing a system that allows investors to observe and multiple independent accountants to securely authenticate and verify the money flow. I would like to see a few companies launched that work this way and it is perfectly doable currently. Ironically it is possibly the regulations in place that make it problematic especially those who make taking in investors without layers of counter parties challenging.  An advanced model will allow companies to be simple programs that run in a decentralized environment. A similar transparent accounting and auditing system will always be required for everything that involves human interaction though.,2014-07-13T12:46:03.000Z,0.25

825,6.0,0,Regarding data compression tech savvy folks here are going to know that you cant compress random data and bitcoin address are statistically indistinguishable from random data.  But you can compress repeated use of identical addresses using look up tables that equate the most commonly used addresses with shorthand forms possibly even using patterns or run length encoding to specify where in the blockchain they appear.  That said I dont think that will do much to shrink the blockchain.  In reality it will become increasingly rarer for people to run full nodes. I havent done this in ages. But it doesnt have to be something that Joe Average does anyway. Think of the DNS  it is decentralized yet it requires a decent investment in infrastructure to run a DNS server. That is how the blockchain is increasingly treated stored in full on smaller numbers of servers only parts of which are used by clients and any given time.  Some people out there will need very big hard drives but the rest of us can just use Electrum Multibit or whatever... and not have to download the whole thing.,2014-07-02T23:23:53.000Z,0.25

850,8.0,0,So youre not to consider bitcoin as a currency youre to consider it an investment? What are you investing in? Bitcoin has no real utility as a currency no intrinsic value no utility in itself so what value does it have?   Youre investing in bitcoin because you expect the price to go up right? Why does the price go up? The price goes up because every person who buys a bitcoin at a higher price expects that they will be able to sell it further down the line to someone else for an even higher price.   Is this expectation of future demandrise in prices based on any change in the valueperformance of the bitcoin? No partly because bitcoin simply isnt capable of changing in intrinsic value but more importantly because it has no value.   And what do we call this? Its called speculation... What happens to speculative bubbles?  Sure you can make money on a speculative bubble. Consider the housing bubble tons of people made money off of the crazy speculation. If you stop there it sounds great for all those people who threw everything they had and anything they could leverage into the market. But when you consider that most of those people lost everything and it helped catalyze perhaps one of the greatest economic crashes since the Great Depression it doesnt sound so great.  The difference between speculation on bitcoin and speculation on housing is that housing has objective intrinsic value and very real utility. You could expect the crash to bottom out and the market to recover because it was based on something with legitimate value. Bitcoin doesnt have that. When it goes its gone and theres no recovery because there simply isnt anything to recover. You will lose everything.,2014-04-11T15:33:10.000Z,0.25

There are entire businesses in China gold farms which consist of having people play WoW  hrsday in poor conditions in order to get gold in the game and then exchange it for other currencies you might call this mining if you want but farming is the term that stuck. Economists and sociologists have written quite a bit about realworld purchases using virtual currencies and related issues such as money laundering since the late s.  Bitcoin is different in having a decentralized ledger which is its main innovation.

887,-2.0,1,gt You compared bitcoins to cash not to an insured and secure bank.  Um duh?! Thats what I said Im doing! And by lost I mean you are carrying your bitcoins on you and you drop or lose the thing youre carrying them on. If you were carrying your cash youre screwed. Sure you can put your cash into someone elses hands and spend probably  of your economy to keep it safe... Imagine if all that percent of your economy could be used on something other than just keeping your cash safe.  gt Are you saying people dont trust their banks?  Lol!!! Are you saying they do? Then why do we have FDIC and so many financial regulations to keep them in check? You would trust your bank even if you knew it doesnt have massive regulatory pressure keeping it in check?  gt It doesnt cost a massive fortune to send money  To send money you pay to make sure your bank has your money to make sure it doesnt spend or invest it poorly to make sure that its secure enough to not get robbed or hacked to make sure it will reimburse you if it loses it to make sure there is a system that your bank and the recipient bank can transfer money to make sure that this system is secure and is not hacked which apparently it is to make sure the recipient is a good person and to audit to make sure the money left one account and got into the other account properly. You pay for all that in part by taxes in part by bank fees and charges on loans and other bank services and in part by allowing your bank to rent out your money at high interest rates and give you  or a bit more than that in return. Its like Ill give you my apartment for a year you can rent it out to whoever you want for  a month and then you can give me  every month for free! So although you dont see it directly yes it costs a massive fortune to do something as simple as send some of your money elsewhere.  gt You dont send someone  so they can spend it at Overstock you send money to pay for rent and emergencies.  Right now you cant spend Bitcoin for rent and emergencies though in some place you can but you can already spend Bitcoin on about  of things you may need without needing to cash it out. And you can actually cash it out that same day within a few hours though it wont be cheap.  gt Why not Bury it in the ground?  Because Im not a redneck and stupid ideas like that dont cross my mind cant a curious dog follow the weird smell and dig it out at night? Or anyone else who sees you digging?  gt If bitcoin collapses due to bad investmentswhatever Gox NeoBee...  Lol! Thats not bitcoin collapsing. Wtf?! D Yes if you put your money with an unregulated and uninsured third party there is a risk it will disappear. It doesnt actually matter if the money is bitcoin or dollars. Bad investments collapse. Thanks Captain Obvious.  The point is that I have no choice but to use a third party service if I want to make my cash digital and thus they better be insured and regulated. I have tons of choices if Im using bitcoin from just doing the security myself to using an insured and regulated bitcoinstoring third party to using cryptographically secure systems like multi signature accounts that dont even need insurance or regulation.  gt Theyll have bitcoins not cash. This isnt usable for everyday commerce  And yet I have been using it for everyday commerce since June so... And it will only get better  gt Why did you even type this if you intended to compare it to a bank? Normal people keep money in a bank.  Because as you so aptly noticed I was comparing Bitcoin to cash which is what its closer to not a bank. Normal people who have small businesses typically get paid in cash and have to carry that cash. Even if its from their place of business to the bank. Im not even going to go into the fact that a whole lot of normal people cant even get a bank account.  gt  No shit a bank is going to ask where  cash comes from  Im curious what kind of houses are you buying where the downpayment is  O.o  gt Where do the Gox people get their backup from?  How are people carrying Gox on their phone or paper? What the fuck are you even talking about? Are you one of those people who thinks MtGox is the Bitcoin CEO or the company behind bitcoin? Or just an idiot who doesnt realize that keeping and losing your money in Gox is analogous to keeping and losing your money with say Bernie Madoff?  gt internet play money you have to convert to use  Internet play money? You have to convert to use?! ROFL! What an idiot .  gt Bitcoin  great for guns and drugs  Go find your local politician pull down his pants stick your face in his asscrack and shove your tongue deep into his asshole.

959,77.0,0,The  MB limit isnt a problem in itself it is simply a parameter that could be easily changed or lifted in the software if you got everyone to agree to the change. However it is still there for a reason and that reason is that Bitcoin is not particularly scaleable in its current form and while we have never actually reached the block limit or even come close the  MB limit is a good approximation of where Bitcoins scaleability problem becomes a real burden for the network with current technology.  If you have two people and you want to send  MB worth of transactions and then a  MB block of confirmed transactions between them bandwidth or storage is no problem. If you have  people approximately the number of Bitcoin nodes and you were perfectly efficient you could get by with collectively sending  TB of data. Its a lot for every  minute interval but certainly not impossible even today.  But what if you want that network to be redundant self healing and resistant to attack or bad actors in the network? You cant just send the data out once to each node you must have some level of redundancy and so each node will broadcast each transaction and then the  MB block of confirmed transactions out to at least several other nodes and receive several identical copies even after they already have one. The more rebroadcasts the less efficient the network but the more resilient. However more rebroadcasts use up a ton of bandwidth and becomes expensive leading to fewer nodes and centralization of the network.  You can see how even  MB sized blocks would use up enormous bandwidth across the network even with small amounts of redundancy... However  MB block sizes only provides a transaction speed of  transactions per second. Visa processes up to  transactions a second corresponding to a blockchain size of  MB per block. This level of transaction volume in Bitcoin would be a significant burden on nodes and would consume massive amounts of bandwidth between nodes even if there were only a few hundred of them and very little redundancy.  Furthermore while the blockchains current size is about  GB at a constant rate of  transactions per second the chain would be growing at  GB  year. again difficult but not infeasable with current technology. At Visa levels of transactions that growth would be  TB per year which does not lend itself to individual users keeping a copy of the blockchain running on a local machine altruistically to help the Bitcoin cause and promote decentralization.  Generally the solutions to the scaleability problems are centralization and offchain transactions as you point out in your comment  but then what is the fundamental benefit over other third party services like Visa or Paypal? There are some potential software changes that could help curb the growth or community based checkpointing that allow previous transactions to be archived but there isnt really any solution to the problem of decentralized payment processing being highly inefficient. Think of it this way most distributed computing networks break up a process and run each part in parallel. Bitcoin however replicates the same work across each distributed node because it is trustless. This means that as the network grows there is no efficiency gained only more nodes replicating the same work which need to be kept in contact at some expense to the network with n other nodes to maintain resilience against attack.   As Bitcoins network grows in size it gets more robust as a decentralized system but less efficient. High transaction volumes may therefore force it to move away from a decentralized model and towards options such as inhouse transactions with a few corporate? entities that can afford to run nodes in order to keep the network running which allows them to run the services that they profit from.  So the block limit and other parameters like minimum fees are there to help prevent the network from growing in size too quickly until some technology or the software advances to the point where it could handle larger transaction sizes while remaining robust and decentralized. If the limit remains in place fees will rise until enough transactions are prevented to keep the network below  transactionssecond. If the limit is lifted without some other solution it will likely lead to centralization of bitcoin requiring users to trust the motivation and actions of centralized entities that can afford to keep the network running at great personal expense.,2014-05-28T19:58:19.000Z,0.25
960,13.0,0,A few thoughts for today  .  Ive developed a theory that provides a general rule of thumb for evaluating bitcoin business proposals  the quality of the website is generally inversely correlated with the quality of the product.  On the one hand you have pretty websites for companies like Circle the dark wallets and many altcoins but what they are providing is not available buggy or useless.  On the other you have services like the middlecoin pool which has an extremely poor interface but provided a useful service for a time.  This may be for practical reasons as well.  Companies that spend lots of time innovating on their products dont allocate huge amounts of resources on their websites  they spend the time on their products instead.   .  There are quite a few people here who are looking for some sort of mass adoption in order for the next bubble to occur.  I dont agree that any sort of significant adoption is necessary for the next bubble.  I think that again people are assuming that there has already been a lot of bitcoin uptake so there isnt as much room for growth.  On the contrary there has not been as much bitcoin uptake as I believed initially which means every price floor will be higher than most people suspect given a certain level of adoption.  The reason might be that there are a lot more lost coins than anyone believed.   .  There are also some discussions by notable contributors about whether the next bubble will continue to rise without any pop given that Wall Street investors have stronger hands.  This thinking is just as foolish as the people who say that bitcoins will fall to zero and not repeat the bubble cycle.  There are many bubbles in assets like stocks and real estate.  There have been bubbles in things like silver where people lost  of their net worth in a single day.  There have been crashes where the entire market falls  in  minutes due to runaway bots.  Wall Street traders know how to trade in bubbles just like bitcoin traders do so they arent going to hold while everyone else is losing money.    .  That said the amplitude of the bubbles will continue to decrease so perhaps the next crash will only cost  of bitcoins value.  The most recent crash bottomed out at about  and the April crash bottomed out at  although it was actually impossible to buy at those prices with Mt Gox down.  The bubble before that had a  drop.  Bubbles arent going to go away but the crashes will likely become lesser as time goes on.   .  I still believe that the uptrend of this cycle will begin to ramp up towards the second half of June like in other bubbles.  However I think that umoral_agents theory that the bubble might begin more quickly than most people think has some merit.  In the past like in December everyone believed that the market would recover once January  arrived and people went back to work.  But the price actually started to rise on Christmas when nobody was at work.  Predictions from people here have been shown to be consistently a week too late in the past.   Other  For some foreigners here is a lesson in US healthcare.  Americans have had this happen to them before so its nothing new.    I wrote off  yesterday because I decided that it wasnt worth my time to pursue any more given that I hope to make more money working on my mining pool during the valuable hours I have in the evenings.  I will allow the statute of limitations to expire tomorrow.  In this case I submitted claims to UnitedHealthcare on  for four appointments with a doctor over the course of six months.  They had accepted all of my claims before that but now they suddenly need some sort of code called a CPP code.  Their system spit out various errors rejecting these claims and I resubmitted them four times over the course of a year.  They want the doctor to write this code on the bill and resubmit the claim again.  But the doctors office staff all resigned in protest over some issue nobody is in the office when I go there because they are on summer semester hours and they arent answering the phone.  UHC wont allow me to simply write the code on the bill and the doctors practice is so mismanaged they are nowhere to be found so my only recourse is to sue which for only  isnt worth the time.  Three years ago I lost  to UHC in another similar case of denial due to obscure new rules although a class action lawsuit later earned me a consolation check for .

Only possible saving grace and this is a longshot if your belief is that we are headed for  again any time soon if ever is that there are a lot more eyes on Bitcoin this time and more money in circulation. But most of these players can announce that they are shelving or changing their plans just as easily as they announced them in the fist place.  Its not like they are held to their word for any reason other than to make some hay out of the current media buzz around it which once it dies down from red hot to room temperature will not be nearly as useful any more.    Bitcoin is still useful only in theory at this point it still is worse than all the current alternatives at everything it does unless you are trying to move money illicitly or speculate. No one who isnt touched with a little of the zealot fever or who doesnt have hopes pinned on BTCUSD  rising dramatically once more or isnt seeking free media attention would not have any incentive at all to use Bitcoin for anything.

1000,0.0,0,I think the factors that are relevant to price at the moment are      the exchanges are operating more effectively and people are trading on smaller movements like they do with other commoditiescurrencies leading to a dampening effect    there is no significant good news on adoption such as it being accepted by Amazon or PayPal. All the good news is minor good news.    the good news plus the upside risk is balanced by the bad news such as the rather pointless talk about regulation    there is a large number of bitcoins for which the future is uncertain. This includes Mr Nakamotos stash the Silk Road haul and now Mt Goxs missing millions. It is likely that these will be converted into fiat at some time nobody knows when    A large number of people who could and would use Bitcoin have an iPhone and there is no iPhone wallet yet    There are very few routes to invest in bitcoin except by buying some. The exchangetraded funds will alter that.    Multisig will bring much greater security and reliability to endusers but we are waiting for it to be incorporated into mainstream wallets.     I expect a change in any of the above to move the price significantly.,2014-03-17T09:24:57.000Z,0.25

OP uAnalyzerX is offering one notsorelated bit of advice that can help prevent this from being an issue even if you do use poor wallet software and it is definitely good to avoid address reuse for other reasons but by far the most important point to keep in mind is to use wallet software that doesnt suck balls. R and K values are not the only way wallets can screw you over after all.  However proper handling of ECDSA signatures is pretty damned easy for wallet software makers so long as they pay attention. The potential R value mistake already has a dead simple solution so well documented it has its own RFC example.,2014-12-22T13:49:07.000Z,0.5

1010,0.0,0,People who want to move the responsibility of keeping their money safe from them to someone else would be better off using a party that you can share a transaction signature with and thats one of the areas where Bitcoin shines.  If I store my money at a regular bank they can move a great percentage of my money out and around without notifying me.  This leads to fractional reserve banking. The numbers on peoples bank accounts do not prove that banks actually have the money to provide these people with their savings.  Bitcoin makes it possible to have banks who store one half of the signature. This means that they still have the ability to refuse transactions but that they cannot use your money without your permission.  Also cautious clients can keep an eye on the blockchain to find out if the savings remain untouched.   People who like to have their money insured can do so without giving up total control and thats a great leap forward in my opinion.  That said I do not use a Bitcoin bank.,2014-04-19T15:49:15.000Z,0.25

1056,1.0,0,In some parallel universe the bitcoin was invented by the fed. The story went more or less like this  In  it became obvious that the dollar will loose its exclusive role as the worlds reserve currency. Stockpiling other currencies or gold was not really an option for keeping some very exclusive power. Inventing some new asset that would be easy to get hold of some obscene share kf would only be an option if the world could be brought to switch to that asset as a backing asset but to convince the world some secrecy is crucial. Meet Satoshi and his Bitcoin. They start the bitcoin crypto currency scheme make sure to keep a high percentage to themselves and make sure to drive the value up x every year. This is really all it takes to transition a world economy from dollar to bitcoin. At some point when the own bitcoin reserve values more thanthe worlds dollars they declare interchangability of dollar and bitcoin at whatever the rate is. This means stopping the dollar decline before the world totally collapsed in chaos but it also means stopping money printing.,2014-06-15T16:50:32.000Z,0.25

1076,1.0,0,gtIt isnt required to do the job its required to make the state happy. So in order to work and support yourself and survive you have to agree to taxation. That doesnt sound like consent to me.  I never said it was required to actually do the job simply that its required to legally do the job. Again this is like complaining about the rules of club membership.  gtIt has that too but literally everything the government does is force. Every service it provides is funded by money collected via coercion.  No I disagree actually!  gtOK youve finally acknowledged that taxes are collected via threat of force. That took a bit longer than usual but it looks like were on the same page.  Actually I never denied that the threat of force was there.  gtAs for contracts you can have law without the state. Its been done before.  Sure but it basically just puts all the power in the hands of the wealthy even moreso than it is now.  gtBitcoin has been around for about  years now I think. Over that time the value has steadily increased and experienced a month period of instability that only hurt speculators. But the best part about bitcoin? The state has no control over it and can do very little to gain control over it or even regulate it. That gives me a raging liberty boner.  Either way your assertion that its lost  of its value over the last couple of years was incorrect so I corrected you.  This is a wildly unstable commodity though. And your correction was just a disingenuous revision of the facts.  gtSo because I dont want government producing these things that means I dont want them to be produced at all?  Once again not what I wrote. You just value these things provided by the government over freedom. If this wasnt true youd be hacking it in Somalia or whatever the taxless weak state du jour is.  gtWhat is it about the health care industry that makes statists want to treat insurance like some magical item that is immune to market forces? Health insurance is a consumer good. Or service whichever you prefer. Why would you think otherwise?  Because health insurance gets more expensive the more providers there are. Do we really need to talk about risk pools? Why do you think that literally every other country on the planet pays less than we do for health care yet gets similar results? Do you just ignore reality when it doesnt match your preconceptions?  gtIf we nationalize health care then competition disappears and providers get lazy because they get your money regardless of service. Competition increases quality and lowers prices.  citations needed given that reality literally contradicts you. The NHS is a huge success. Meanwhile the  cause of bankruptcies in the US is medical bills.  gtI understand the temptation considering the amount of state indoctrination most of us go through. But try to think of it like this Society is just you and me interacting voluntarily sometimes exchanging goods and services. Government is the guy who comes in the room with a gun demanding our property so he can help us out.  Why would I think about it like this when its literally never been like this?,2014-12-10T23:51:43.000Z,0.25

1086,1.0,0,The blockchain is already proofed from several forms of internet killswitch as is the bitcoin network itself. They can both exist without DNS and with a large number of nodes behind NAT or a stateful firewall. This makes bitcoin potentially usable with only one party and the transmitters having an internet connection as someone could keep a wallet that could receive funds and then pay out by handing a signed transaction directly to a payee for that payee to get into the network at large somehow. This still requires some form of connection either between the payee and the transmitters or the payer and the transmitters transactions need to get to the network at large to be added into blocks and make their way onto the blockchain and thus if the internet at large was subject to deep packet inspection with no ability to send transactions even over tor then this would still only be half the technology needed to make bitcoin work.,2014-07-13T18:05:26.000Z,0.25

Once transactions make it to the blockchain well then your nonpartisan oversight could literally be oversight by anyone and everyone.

1138,1.0,0,The procedure for opening an account on Coinbase is to open the account through a computer not the app as the app is limited.  Indeed you need to register your bank account credit card phone number AND get your identity validated before buying bitcoins instantly. You must validate your identity in order to comply with antimoney laundering laws.  The whole procedure takes only minutes if done correctly.  Once you register bank account CC and validate your identity and add factor authentication for security you can buy a limited amount of bitcoins instantly. About  dollars per week.  days after your firs purchase the limit is raised to  dollars worth of bitcoin every week or so.  The problem in your case was not bitcoin. You just didnt follow the procedure and you didnt inform yourself on the full procedure before using Coinbase.  Trust me Coinbase is a lot less cumbersome than Bitstamp which requires you to email them a scan of your passport and a scan of a bank statement.

1156,1.0,0,The idea is that bitlicense is mostly about kyc aml. That extends far beyond bitcoin customers who oppose it. It means without it one can fund a terrorist or launder stolen money or money gained from sales of stolen goods.  So obviously the bitlicense effects non bitcoin users too who may more broadly agree with strict kyc aml.  Not saying this is the case or that I agree just saying that the democratic process extends beyond the bitcoiners like me who dont like this bitlicense.  In this case I dont see it as a democratic problem as most people agree on the intention of the bitlicense. Sure not everyone but most people would likely vote for some recordkeeping thats a simple fact. The problem is that the imolementation is ridiculous too strict and without a sliding scale to let off smaller operations.,2014-08-21T15:17:05.000Z,0.25

1158,1.0,0,In order to gain the protection of a patent license you need to affirmatively agree to it. We are not at that stage yet but basically   if your company uses Bitcoin you will need to sign up for membership to receive the license its free.   The license will state that it is only valid if you dont sue other members. If  you do sue one of our members your license is revoked and you go on our naughty list. We intend use every resource available to defend our members from you.  The Open Invention Network for Linux has a similar license.  Forgive my typos. On my phone.,2014-06-18T15:03:22.000Z,0.25
1159,1.0,0,Its not about speculation its about utility.   In the real world if I give you something you know youve received it on the internet you receive only a copy of something. What Bitcoin provides is a way for everyone to agree that a transaction has occurred.. thats all Bitcoin is but that is valuable which is why its become usable as currency. If you tie assets to coins  single satoshis even then that is coloured coins you can then exchange the ownership with someone else directly. So your car could know its owner based on the block chain and exchanging the coin related to that changes the reality of who owns the car.. or a gold bar or any other asset.  The action of removing the need for third party authorities is an efficiency saving and its also empowering in a good way that frees up what is possible and practical  its cheaper than any traditional offering. This is what progress looks like. More efficient actions makes more volume in the economy too which is growth.  and were only being to imagine what will be possible now that we can exchange with confidence directly person to person online.,2014-03-20T10:38:13.000Z,0.25

1163,1.0,0,I dont understand how you feel soon. Salaries are paid in fiat and are typically stored in bank accounts where cc are linked to but to use Bitcoin that is  extra step you need to convert your fiat into Bitcoin even when we do get plenty of exchangesATM worldwide within the next decade that extra step is not going away soon at all until main transactions are done in crypto currencies.

1165,1.0,0,Im not annoyed mate but some whitelines wouldve been nice P  Anyway this isnt really good news for institutional money because SecondMarket already covered that with its investment vehicle. This is actually required by a lot of institutional money because unlike bitcoin the shares in the bitcoin fund are securities. Institutional money cant deal with bitcoin right now but they can deal with securities just fine in their accounting and auditing processes. SecondMarket already covered this and now they offer the actual bitcoins too but its definitely not for institutional investments.  Also its not an exchange you mentioned this. You also mentioned its a brokerdealer which is correct. Barry Silbert himself stated its not an exchange and really its not because they seem to source and liquidize their coins at actual exchanges they dont seem to intend to do matchmaking internally as an exchange would they just facilitate the trade as a counterparty at an exchange buying from or selling to parties they dont know e.g. some random guy at Bitstamp. However they have announced the exchange for after the summer later this year. Indeed what you said isnt far off although building the order book is perhaps not the right way to put it. After all theyre a broker so they go to an exchange and settle that order immediately. Its not like theyre building up orders for  months until they have an exchange ready. But they are building awareness relationships with highvalue customers etc and that allows them to kickstart an order book much faster than starting from scratch indeed.  About Coinbase its a bit murky what they are. They do have a brokerdealer license and an MSB license but the latter one not in every state. I cant find SecondMarkets MSB license by the way.  I dont think many companies have actually filed for MSB licenses in most states. Its not really a matter of the states granting it its likely they will theyre legally bound to as long as the company files the necessary paperwork regardless of whether they intend to trade bitcoin or fiat you can have a license and do absolutely nothing or do nothing that involves the license like trade cows if you wanted. The reason it hasnt happened is because its still prohibitively expensive to do so. You pretty much always need a surety bond and these can be really expensive especially for bitcoin companies which are rated as high risk by most surety bond companies and most wont even service you as they dont understand the risk.  Not sure to what extent regulators are looking the other way. I think rather not all states actually implemented the guidance by Fincen. I think only Texas has so far.

It causes no problems so long you and everyone else doesnt use any of their Bitcoins or Foocoins doesnt sound so useful to me.  Its simply incorrect to state that its not an altcoin its a seperate orthorgonal ledger that immediately doubles the supply of cryptocurrency and creates a base of people with commercial interests _directly_ opposed to Bitcoin who stand to profit by driving the adoption of their alternative in parallel to Bitcoin.  To the noncryptocurrency using public the issue of cryptocurrency remains looking unsafe and unsettled.  gt after trading starts its not the same ledger but it remains the same for anyone who chooses not to speculate  Correct but you have it backwards Its only the same when everyone chooses to speculate and to hold on to their newly inflated worthless FooCoins.,2014-10-25T07:05:02.000Z,0.25

1187,1.0,0,Speaking on a personal level I regularly listen to people who have differing views from mine  even those Im strongly opposed to. For instance Im opposed to Bitcoin and have dismissed it as viable in the long term but I still readlisten to the arguments expressed here on a regular basis.  I dont just believe that people have a right to express their views but I think it is their right to be heard and our obligation to listen  not just for their benefit as perhaps a threatened minority but because we all benefit from increased dialogue.   Mill lays out the argument well in On Liberty but to put it in simple and concise terms Even if the person we listen to is wrong perhaps there is still something we can learn. Perhaps there is a grain of truth in what he says that may better our own understandings or perhaps he will shed light on our own misunderstandings or lack of understanding  for instance the fool might say The earth is flat We immediately call him a fool.. but come to think of it how do we know the earth is not flat? And so our own investigation begins as a result of this provocation. Our knowledge of the truth increased whether we are right or wrong in any case.  However the reason in this case I attack George Gilder on the basis of his character is because it is his character being presented upon which I am to judge. It is not an argument being presented merely that we should upvote a pronouncement because this guy George Gilder for some reason should carry weight by his name alone.  I have asked twice now of two different users to present the argument which they seem to claim George Gilder is making. I am still waiting for a response.

1206,1.0,0,Bitcoins are not files.  They are public database entries. They are just assertions of numbers belonging to the people in control of the private keys that correspond to various public keys being and that only they have right to assign those numbers to other peoples keys. The private keys can be torrented but that would just be stupid.  Music and videos are stored in files.  A bitcoin is an entry in a distributed database that everybody have access to.  You can not magically revoke access to the contents of files. Likewise the previous bitcoin owners dont lose access to the database entries when signing over their bitcoins they only lose the power to continue to reassign them.  You also can not magically make a file available to somebody only if they pay in a decentralized network using only distributed algorithms without anybody else being able to recover the file even without paying.  You dont seen to understand the concepts yet of how this stuff works.  The only thing you CAN do is to set up a server that will give people access to download the files if they can show they paid this is already being done with Bitcoin. But they will be able to share it to people who didnt pay.,2014-01-15T15:46:23.000Z,0.25

1220,1.0,0,Good points on both sides of this discussion but I have to agree with the following general sentiment   .  of the possible shoppers understanding Bitcoin would be optimistic.   . Companies like these accepting Bitcoin for retail goods will create an accountingrevenue NIGHTMARE due to the insane volatility of BTC.   Plus  how does Overstock or Zynga cash out their newfound BTC pile? Serious question  would they just include BTC wallets in their quarterly earnings and if so how would shareholders respond or value them?   . Put bluntly the knickknack stores and companies taking Bitcoin are primarily just novelties held up by the BTC community socks being a good example. Its great that they get supportpurchases from the community but who was looking for alpaca socks before they were BTCfriendly?  The worst part of all this is how exploitable these companies could become if they sell consumer electronics and highend retail stuff for BTC.

Not as long as you think that there is also a good possibility that it will become the dominant one.   If Bitcoin isnt the everlasting crypto then  is INSANE and even if it was guaranteed to be the majorityuse crypto  is insane when every other alt functions the same at fractions of a penny. Youre quite delusional if you think people will just mindlessly buy Bitcoins at an inflated price when other options exist.

Taxes based on rising exchange rates sounds like a reasonable alternative.  gt Forfeit Bitcoins  Nobody wants this. Forfeiture to the state should only occur if forfeiture to company is the other option.  gt Bitcoin mixing  This is strange and somewhat technically taxing.

1292,1.0,0,I assumed this as well since the system is designed to get exponentially bigger over time as you mentioned. But disregarding that assuming they develop some novel way of countering this which we know probably wont happen as no actual development is going on as a handful of people cant create a financial system from scratch with little or no compensation the end state of bitcoin will be one of selling massive amounts of coin to maximize actual profit for large holders with the small investors getting buttfucked as their transactions continually fail and an exchange run occurs.  I do agree your scenario is THE MOST likely but just looking at fundamentals it looks like this thing is dead in the water long term through simple economics.  The important thing to realize here too is the nature of the time horizon we are looking at.  A lot of the time especially in stuff like intro industrial organization you imagine a one or two round decision making event. First round Choose to sell at x second round choose to sell at xy as the first round purchasers can sell their stuff again and you need to sell at a lesser price as you are now competing with your previous purchase price etc blah blah blah. Then you are introduced to infinite time horizons and see equilibrium can exist there with an infinite future.  But when you have stuff that is an infinite horizon to people unfamiliar with the concept say bitcoin no longer being created in over a century from now but not infinite to those who understand the concept  years is not infinite obviously you realize that those who understand they have a finite horizon to work with will act before those who dont believe they have a finite horizon to work with.  The equilibrium in those systems tends to be   Everybody gets along and things work perfectly before the last round.   Last round occurs. Informational asymmetry is present. Some actors see an infinite timeline and play according to those rules which tend to be what most would consider more egalitarian or freemarket even. Some see the finite timeline and know when the last round is. Those that know when the last round is sell as appropriate. Those who assumed an infinite timeline take a major loss.

1302,1.0,0,Bitcoin generates math problems for people to solve.  Computers all attempt to find the next hash the answer to the problem which is a very computational intensive time consuming task.  They all race to find the answer and whichever computer does is rewarded with some bitcoins.  There are now machines designed to have as many parallel computations going on as possible thus maximizing its mining potential per multiple factors cost size and cost of electricity are three such parameters.   I believe the math problem they are required to answer is the hash that stores all prior bitcoin transactions in the smallest amount of data possible but Im not sure.  I do know that bitcoin stores this information with the hash though.  It keeps a history of all recent transactions for a period of time then eventually far enough back in time where the microtransactions no longer matter it merges everything into a single state.  So you have a starting state  all the transactions up until now.,2014-01-25T21:35:58.000Z,0.25

1317,1.0,0,gt wouldnt lower inflationless mining in the face of higher value make the problem worse?  It sure as hell does.  gt Its also very hard to find real explanations of the economics of it.  Thats because there are very few.  The design itself didnt quite take economics into consideration.  When economics does come up leading opinions tend to be fringe libertarian daydream discounting quite valid worries and fetishizing deflation. Its essentially a two legs bad four legs good narrative with nobody really questioning what is up.  Im sure many people in the movement who understand the fundamentals of all this are busy exploiting it and making some money at the detriment of the community say by creating clone currencies pumping and dumping them.  When skeptics or mainstream economists attack the problem their approach tends to remain at the level of an attack. Why cryptocurrencies wont work and why Bitcoin is stupid. While their points are valid they arent constructive at all.,2014-03-07T18:02:42.000Z,0.0
1318,1.0,0,cont.  Since Charlie wrote about the other aspects pertaining to confusion this focuses mainly on the technical and economic issues.  Fallacy Slower PoW is Safe from ASICs? The escalating N proposals all suffer from the issue where increasingly slow PoW by design makes it much slower to verify thereby worsening block propagation latency across the multihop PP network.  Block propagation latency is already a growing problem on the Bitcoin network where larger blocks take longer to traverse the network.  With an escalating memory PoW the smallest of blocks would suffer from increased propagation delay.  At best this means increased annoyance from more frequent accidental orphans.  At worst higher propagation latency reduces the cost of perverse mining behaviors like doublespending attacks.  Furthermore it is doubtful that escalating N would be truly ASIC proof.  Since the deployment schedule of future N is known nearterm ASICs could cut costs as they need not implement distant future N in hardware because early generation custom hardware will be unable to compete on power cost with later generation custom hardware.  We already see this today with first generation Avalon and ASICMINER miners currently so power cost uncompetitive that they are being given away at the cost of disposal.  Others have attempted to solve the issue of greater propagation latency with a new PoW that is very memoryhard to mine but not to verify and thus fast to validate.  That was the goal of Bitshares Momentum.  Unfortunately for them many of their past designs were broken within minutes on the Bitcoin forum.  This demonstrates how hazardous it can be to implement your own algorithm.  Even the currently used Momentum has a TMTO attack proven on GPU bad enough that the k bounty was paid out.  adamus said i think gmaxwell argument was if the memory hw required per compute hw was small enough to fit within the blank space required to not overheat the chip then it doesnt really slow the hw down.  and i guess it ends up being much more parallel and faster than you can do on a GPU  XPM may not be safe either.  adamus said i was thinking people might be setting their hopes in primecoin PoW as another option because it involves bignums ... eg there are SSL acceleratedbignum accelerator hw. so probably that can be done also  seems like a game of cat and mouse where hw wins if there eventually is enough incentive to build the hw  In these examples they made hashes more complex and increased the cost of ASIC development but if your coin becomes popular enough then ASICs become economically feasible.  X is Far Worse X suffers from the problems stemming from increased propagation latency and slow verification and adds even worse susceptibility to ASIC advantage.  It is a mere mishmash of  separate algorithms that are now GPU mineable according to Darkcoins homepage.  Anything GPU mineable can be implemented in custom hardware.  To make matters worse ASICs could even have a major speedup advantage over GPUs.   adammus said it does seem likely that eg if the unused space due to heat can be filled with the other hashes then it can all be pipelined together and no slowdown.  the only cost is replicating different hash functions which doesnt seem particularly hard  So a switch to X only delays the inevitable.  Switching the hash to X would only spite the current manufacturers while ultimately failing in the goal of preventing ASICs later.  It gets even worse.  If the cost of entry for a particular PoW is very high by design that increases the chance of fewer competing manufacturers entering a market.  This is the worst possible outcome for any Bitcoinlike network that relies upon large quantities of greedy miners to outdo each other to maintain network security.  Arbitrary Hardforks Hardly Inspires Confidence Bitcoin and Litecoin are exceedingly careful in avoiding unnecessary rule changes that completely breaks sync compatibility with old clients.  Prior to the official release of Litecoin ..x we carefully reviewed the code multiple times and even hired an external expert to quadruple check our work to reduce the likelihood of accidents.  Bitcoin has many users still using very old versions.  The Litecoin network is less afraid of using alerts and other discouragement to coax users onto newer versions yet there still persist many old clients that are at risk of accidental hardfork from the BIP BDB lock limit issue.  Old clients are highly discouraged but they remain somewhat compatible because both networks have never forced any completely incompatible blocklevel protocol change upon users.  Contrast this to various amateur clones of Bitcoin.  They are characterized by a rush to market with code that was not well designed or tested often containing errors that require mandatory hardforks to correct.  Sometimes hastily written fixes have introduced additional problems often resulting in further mandatory upgrades.  Often on their forums weeks after a hardfork you see confused users who are on an old chain.  Stability of the protocol matters a great deal to the perceived viability of a network as a longlasting medium of commerce.  Litecoin has been strong because of doing things in the Bitcoin way just with different hardware protecting its network.  If Litecoin were to fundamentally change the rules for reasons unrelated to technical correctness and in a way that requires everyone to suddenly change their software it would make people question the stability of the network and the professionalism of its developers.  Centralized Mining problematic long before ASIC In the end a greater threat is centralized pooled mining.  This problem is inherent to Bitcoinlike networks and existed long before the coming of ASICs.  The Litecoin Dev Team invested resources and funds to help with PPool for the benefit of both Bitcoin and Litecoin and we acknowledge the Eligius approach with the GBT protocol is another important approach where miners can completely stop a pool from withholding blocks.  A Litecoin develoer has even brokered an agreement in principle with a major institutional miner to agree to independent rd party monitoring to create new tools to alert vendors of block withholding on the Bitcoin network if other major pools and institutional miners agree to identical monitoring.  If successful for Bitcoin this model may be needed on the Litecoin network.  There is a great deal more work needed to be done on this front to reduce risks of mining centralization on both the Bitcoin and Litecoin network.  Conclusion What makes Litecoin strong is its closeness to the good parts of Bitcoin with a few small but meaningful improvements like faster confirmations and discouragement of spam.  Its developers are heavily involved in improving both Bitcoin and Litecoin as part of their professional careers.  Good luck to the longterm longevity of forks.,2014-03-31T14:46:47.000Z,0.25

1321,1.0,0,Back then  years ago I was having  BTC now I have about . Why... First of all I was very anxious to hold that much USD on exchanges and secondly I was blinded by hope somehow Bitcoin can keep the price steady at around  before another bubble. Take that  some wrong trades and catastrophic loss on Vertcoin.  Every bubble is the same price corrects to about  of peak and its doing it in waves  even if you didnt sell before the first crash you should wait because price returns to about  of peak and thats where you make your sell orders.  Learned on my own mistakes after  bubbles I know what its all about and Im completely positive I wont screw up next time.  Recipe for behaviour in cryptoworld if you have substantial amounts of money in crypto   Use Linux because you dont want malware stealing your keystrokes.  Open accounts on as much exchanges as possible. FA is essential.  After bubble pops sell crypto in huge deadcat bounce and keep USD on exchanges as long as it is needed to rebuy low.  With about  of your capital speculate on young and promising coins like BTSX and NEOS that was free commercial   ...and Im still holding Bitcoin because I really believe it wont go down anymore see that K sell wall on Bitstamp is being eaten rapidly. Finally some bull whales realised thats a dirt cheap Bitcoin right now at the disposal.  P.S. Just to make clear I already spent more than I invested  years ago so dont have much reason to cry but still imagine your USD stash going down for x.

Apple has as much right as any other business to implement a coloured coin and if they did a lot of others would try it as well.  I dont think they will though. Its too early. I think they still see bitcoin as too immature for their needs with too many regulatory hurdles and questions over legal status and tax treatment to make it worth the hassle.

What do you think is the most important thing to know about doge coin for those of us that are unknowledgable in its ways?  A basic understanding of cryptocoins in general In terms of doge this is a currency designed to be spent and to allow people to easily conduct transactions its not meant to be an investment vehicle where a few people get richer at the expense of the many and the community supports this.  Do you believe there is a stigma against digital currency Thanks uRhandyRhoads for reminding us about the distinction?  Yes. Its new its different and many people dont understand it and thus are inclined to fearmistrust it. Some criticisms are wellfounded especially for bitcoin tax evasion money laundering silk road high volatility fraud and theft.

1346,1.0,0,The answer is basically .  But if it works in the future the answer would be all of them.  Yes it would basically be faster than all of the Bitcoin network combined.  How is that possible?    Quantum computers theoretically could solve a hash in one single step.  That is right input the public key and get the private key in one computational cycle.  Is this going to happen in the next  years?  NO.  Two problems.   Problem  The Dwave may not even be a quantum computer at all.  It may just be simulating one.  And you can do this for simple items but not for complex ones as the amount of work increases exponentially.  There is no hard evidence the Dwave is quantum and not just a quantum simulator.  Problem   To solve SHA you need a hell of a lot more then  quibbits.  And adding quibbits adds noise to the system in such a way that it becomes exponentially harder to do.  So if the dwave was real to break SHA it would be millions of times harder to construct a machine to do it.  It borders on the edge of theoretically impossible.    Right now it would be easier to build energy positive fusion system than it would be to build a SHA quantum computer.  Both are  years away or more.,2014-02-20T20:58:16.000Z,0.25

1356,1.0,0,yes basically what Quadra said is causing a sort of feedback loop or standing wave.  Diff goes down which causes profitswitching pools to jump in which causes diff to go up which causes profit switching pools to leave. The back and forth motion is displaying itself every alternating difficulty adjustment.  The oscillations are getting wider though. The bottom level is the floor of the longterm miners. So the fact that the bottom of the cycles difficulty is getting lower means that the overall fulltime doge mining is going down.   The upper level getting higher in relation to the lower indicates that theres a larger number of pools switching in. This may be because there are simply more profit switching pools but you can also bet that all of these coins are being immediately dumped on the market for a profit in btc or .   The thing about difficulty is the profit is made in the leading edge where the hashrate goes up but the difficulty hasnt Snapped up to the next level yet.  Blocks are found faster at the present hash rate and the difficulty hasnt adjusted yet. You can see this in a much slower way by looking at the Bitcoinwisdom charts for Litecoin where you can see the hash rate climb before the difficulty does. This is where you get more coins for your effort.  As soon as the adjustment happens theres a retreat in doge at least This WAS going on with Litecoin until the last two difficulty adjusts. Now like bitcoin it appears it may just be climbing.  So its possible that the multipools which are causing this cyclical behavior could be another factor thats driving the price down. The multipools are extracting an inordinate amount of coins from the mining factory and taking those for immediate sales and turnaround.    This leaves less coins for normal miners i.e. actual shibes than there would be at the constant bottom difficulty who are less likely to simply cash them out at current market price to make an immediate profit from their KHs.,2014-03-09T18:05:42.000Z,0.25
1357,1.0,0,I put my . MHs rig on wafflepool the night of April rd and have earned . bitcoin so far. Dividing that number by . which is the current satoshi of dogecoin I have earned  dogecoin. I was apparently getting  dogecoin per day mining on a PPool which seemed considerably more profitable than other nonppools I have gone on before so thats what I was on before wafflepool.    dogecoinin . days  . days dogecoin   doge.  Now times are not exact so this could be a little bit off but now I can see there really is not much difference in payouts so far. So if you want to help out the dogecoin network I would definitely recommend it. Other coins are not nearly as stable and profitable so if youre going for another currency multipools are probably best for getting the most for your hashes.  So there actually is not a whole lot of difference between ppool mining and multipool mining in my experience at least so far. Itd probably be better to update in a few days when everything averages out a little bit more but the numbers I have already seem pretty inline with what one would expect.,2014-04-05T12:17:59.000Z,0.25

They do something similar now by working with companies to help them accept bitcoin and then convert it.   If I buy crypto on Coinbase Im not buying a share in a vaporware infrastructure that may or may not exist in the future Im just using them as a vendor. They get my money I get some crypto. Its a purchase of an existing somewhat more familiar if not predictable instrument not a speculative investment on a brand new completely unknown instrument.  gt Do you see where your doge is heading now that the pump is over?  Im astounded doge has managed to hold over  satoshi I think its hilarious! Im way long on blockchains but Im not convinced any of the current coins will hold majority market shares in  years. There will be a lot of time to move into better positions as they present themselves so lots of fun to be had along the way.  gt There always needs to be a central hub otherwise it will not amount to anything or will take decades to get somewhere.  Great thing about taking decades to get somewhere is that when you get there you usually end up taking over the world along the way. Blockchains will do this in the same way UNIX ideas took over the world via BSD and Linux and hypertext took over the wold via HTTP. The datastructure will stand on its own and be stronger for it.  Edit many of these criticisms also apply to doge and bitcoin businesses and I wouldnt recommend those as investments either if they were advertising heavily.

On average bitcoin is insanely dangerous to whoever wants to get into it.  Want me to list all the ways you can lose your money?  How about just a few ways?  Bitcoin exchanges failing.  Losing your backups.  Getting hacked.  Having someone rob you.  Having someone watch over your shoulder while you type your encryption phrase in.  Etc etc.  The fact that people here are so cavalier about a  attack shows just how little they understand the technical details of it.  Inflation robs people huh?  Then you might be surprised to find out that bitcoin itself is inflationary and will continue to be for quite awhile!  Its only deflationary when it stops creating new coins.

1442,2.0,0,There is a ledger that keeps track of all bitcoins. This ledger is called the blockchain. Everytime you send bitcoin to someone the miners put the transaction into a block and attaches it to the previous block. Hence the name blockchain. But its a ledger really. Everytime a miner finds or creates a new block he is rewarded with  newly created bitcoin. This means you have to be a miner and you have to have enough hashing power to produce blocks in order to get freshly minted bitcoin or poof them into existence as you said.,2014-11-10T12:56:32.000Z,0.25

1450,2.0,0,I should mention his general impression is positive. Heck he loved the idea from what I understand since he first heard about it. Just in terms of value however he thinks it will take a hit before it it climbs again and he gives you some convincing analytics that kind of say that. He thinks it is brilliant and it could really take off but that it is due for a nose dive. Therefore the people that recommended him to me told me to get out of bitcoin for the time being. I had to explain that Im not in it for the money right now. It just fascinates me and I dont have enough invested that would depress me if the value decimated. And if it did I would buy even more bitcoin. I wouldnt look at it as losing dollars but as an opportunity to just buy more bitcoin. Also while he thinks it may be due for a nosedive like it hasnt seen before I believe that all it takes is an exchange to open up in a country with serious economic issues for demand to shoot up again. Like you were saying I believe this technology is disruptive enough that it kind of breaks the mold when it comes to conventional analysis. I believe that we will see a  bitcoin one day so beating myself up over a sub  hit would be silly IMO.,2014-01-16T12:02:10.000Z,0.25
1451,2.0,0,gt how do i get BTC  Without knowing your status where you are located citizenship whether you have a bank account etc. I can only recommend localbitcoins.com. There are far more convenient ways though.  Also earning Bitcoin directly can also be convenient depending on what you do for a living.  gt keep it secure?  For long term investments of nontechies people recommend paper wallets. You can make multiple copies and can optionally use a password for extra security. Creating these papers on a clean offline computer is recommended so booting with a secure live Linux CD can be a good idea.  The most convenient way to spend it is via your mobile device since QRcode support is very widespread. Keeping a backup of your mobile wallet and using a strong passphrase to protect it is recommended. I use Myceliums app but there are other nice apps out there.,2014-02-05T15:43:46.000Z,0.25

The point is that as more and more merchants begin to adopt Bitcoin its utility increases significantly until they are able to recycle Bitcoin by paying suppliers employees etc etc. We cant get to that point without first going through a phase where most merchants convert to dollars because running their business on Bitcoin is not yet possible.

1460,2.0,0,gtBitcoin needs a political strategy and it must evolve to address legitimate criticisms.  The problem is organising a political strategy is difficult. bitcoiners believe in different political ideas. Already we are seeing the divide between those who are more libertarian and those who who are more socialist. The concerns of some in the community are the benefits to others.  Bitcoin will evolve in its own way but trying to influence this process will be quite difficult it depends on the politics of those joining the bitcoin community. More people are joining bitcoin for its practical points rather than the politics and its likely that bitcoin will swing more towards fitting in with the existing structures we have in the world today.  For the earlier more political adopters there will definitely be frustration and the next generation of cryptocoins will likely be designed to include more assertive political statements.,2014-02-07T17:41:04.000Z,0.25

1466,2.0,0,Youre using words a  year old would not understand. Heres a translation  Margin Trading is when you borrow bitcoinsUSD and bet against bitcoin going up or down. So you go long this means betting bitcoin will go up and youve borrowed  bitcoin. Bitcoin goes from  to  youve made . You take the profit and give the bitcoins back  a small fee. If the price were to go down to  youve lost  and need to pay that back to the lender.   Say you actually owned  bitcoin in the scenario above nonborrowed. Thats  margin trading ie losses are amplified x. If you lost  you would need to sell part of that bitcoin to pay the lender back.  If bitcoin went from say  to  thats a  loss since you borrowed  bitcoins and each lost  and youd have to sell your entire bitcoin to pay back the lender. When youre forced to sell like that its called a margin call.  So because so many people are going long right now and the price crashes they get margin called are forced to sell their bitcoin which drives the price lower... creating more margin calls. Im sure you get it.,2014-08-18T18:43:55.000Z,0.25

1473,2.0,0,gtThe more Bitcoin appreciates in value the easier it is for Bitcoin evangelists to point to the significant price increase as a benefit for adoption. Its fair game to do this but what youre doing here is appealing to greed. Greed is super effective in persuasion but it attracts people to Bitcoin who probably shouldnt be into Bitcoin. Those people being Wall Streeter types who tend to get into things purely to profit from them. They will unquestionably be quick to jump ship at the first sign of any existential threat to Bitcoin.  To the author   Dont worry as the price goes up Bitcoin is in a bubble a ponzi scheme or has no intrinsic value gets thrown around by a lot of people. Realize getting over all the negativity just because you think you can make money off of this is already hard enough for people to do. I bet there are actually very few people invested who dont also really understand Bitcoins true potential. So keep in mind that price is mainly reflective of adoption not adoption due to price. In the early days that was more prominent but even now that is still mainly the case. All of these Wall Streeter types are simply people who actually understand Bitcoin just like you or I do...

1483,2.0,0,Exactly.  If their understanding of the value and benefits of bitcoin is this shallow. . . if it is limited to its value as a payment network bitcoin may not be demanded sufficiently and may fail to achieve unitofaccount currency status.  I never placed much importance or priority on bitcoin as a payment system.  Im fairly certain that apple and Visa and google and others will be able to easily outperform bitcoin in the near future along many fronts such as micropayments transaction fees userside security etc.  This is the shallow understanding of the value of the technology.  Fortunately people do and will value bitcoin for a whole range of other reasons. . . perhaps some of those reasons being out of your scope of understanding.

1484,2.0,0,I think its easier if you use potatoes and I still dont think youre getting it right.   Year  BTC can buy you  potatoes.   Year  BTC can buy you  potatoes  Thats  deflation. The BTC amounts never change but their purchasing power does.   The problem is that banks want to make money with their money. They want to lend it out and charge interest.   So they want to lend out BTC and get back .BTC. A nice  RoI.   The problem is that after a year with  deflation and  interest the borrower will be paying back  potatoes for their  potato loan.   The problem gets worse because in a deflating currency economy that persons employer would also reduce their pay by the amount of bitcoin deflation that year.. Or maybe only decrease it a bit effectively a pay rise if theyre nice.   So they need to pay back  on their loan but because they get their wages in bitcoin theyll actually also have  less bitcoins to pay back with.   Its a complete bullshit deal for the borrower. Its such a bullshit deal that it runs the risk of the borrower defaulting since its almost like a feedback loop of debt where its very hard to win.   So the increased risk  increased rates.   And then the problem is just compounded.   Lending in a deflationary currency doesnt and cant work. Borrowers wouldnt be stupid enough to do it lenders... Wouldnt be stupid enough to do it.,2014-03-27T18:17:55.000Z,0.25

But i dont see a big problem in hoarding Bitcoin. It is ok if Bitcoin is used mostly as a store of value the next few years  Gold for example is worth something and it mostly is just a store of value because it is heavy and no one wants to cary it arround to buy something.   By the time more people will use Bitcoin as payment system if they gain advantages of it. I think it is good if people actively push using Bitcoin as form of payment to make adoption faster. But if Bitcoin is good then it is only a matter of time until it is is used by many people. If it sux then it will die  if you push using it or not.,2014-03-12T08:53:22.000Z,0.25

Easy to lose? Its in its infancy improvements like Trezor are coming and more innovation will follow.   You have to pay taxes on bitcoin? So what? If anything that tells me that its gained enough legitimacy. Why should bitcoin fall outside of the law?  Its not anonymous? Again so what? Im not buying drugs or weapons online anyway. And if you really want to hide it you can. That can address the taxes issue as well. The fact that the blockchain is public is a selling point not a scare tactic you knucklehead.  The only thing that is somewhat valid with is the threat of a  attack and they missed the point with that one as well. Its not the existing miners that are worrying they have a vested interest in the success of the currency and an attack would destroy trust and cause the price to plummet its more like banksgovernments taking control and thats unlikely.,2014-01-31T16:28:45.000Z,0.25

Yes theyve offloaded all the feesnow known as spread and risk to the consumer.  That is one of the reasons demand is nonexistent.  It doesnt offer benefits to users over existing systems.  It just pushes the costs on them and removes consumer protections.  gtNo in this case Im not. Mining may be bruteforcing in a certain sense but youll never brutforce an address is what I mean.  I know.  That is why I said youre confusing the PoW stuff with the addresses.  SHA is used for the PoW only.  A break in it would allow people to mine blocks much easier than other miners it wouldnt allow them to take coins from peoples wallets or anythingwell kind of with much easier mining they could rewrite the chain fairly easily.  gtIve heard this before but I dont understand how you think banks can drop their prices to match bitcoin. Banks could match the price of bitcoin only by losing money on each transaction.  Youre assuming banks arent ridiculously profitable.  The expensive parts of banking is having branches for people to go to.  Bitcoin doesnt get rid of that need.  The actual moving of money is cheap for banks.  If you have a lot they will even do it for free for you.  gtI mean look at Western Union do you think they can drop their prices to match bitcoin and stay in business? They charge  in some parts of Africa do you think thats an arbitrary number or that it reflects actual cost of doing business at least to some extent.  They charge  because they have locations all over the place.  For bitcoin to compete it would need similar things and there is no indication that those locations would charge any less than WU.  gtThat ignores the buy in from retailers and miners especially miners as well as the overall testing of the core technology. A new coin would still require many years of fronting before it could be considered battle hardened and proved. Its not easy to write bulletproof code everyone knows this. It can be done but generally its not worth doing. Except for something like this.  Facebook has better chip designers than any mining company and the funds to produce much better miners than any of the current mining companies.  Retailers almost universally use rd parties like bitpaycoinbaseetc.  Facebook could easily pay these companies to start processing their coin too and they all would jump at the chance.  Suddenly all their retailers accept it now too.  gtAnd yet they tremble.  The only trembling I see is your fellow rbitcoin users every time an altcoin is mentioned.  They seriously go off the rails in fear of any competition.  gtBut we do see that already. Because bitcoin is cheaper to use and gaining in value. Whatever the market cap of bitcoin is now thats value that is not being kept in traditional banking and that is a threat to them should that trend continue.  You dont though.  There has been very little growth in users over the past year outside of the bubble and that just ended up pushing a lot of people away.  gtGood enough but not cheaper. And thats a problem for them. If traditional banking had price parity then good enough would be. But losing the price war is death for traditional banking.  So if I created an alt coin with cheaper transaction fees it would win?  Of course not because those fees arent the most important thing unless they are completely unaffordable.,2014-07-27T07:58:49.000Z,0.25

1519,2.0,0,I know this was an issue on Bitcoin talk and Ive followed your case for a long time cedivad. I understand your frustration but it seems to be the case that the Hashfast chips work but they cant produce a board worth a damn see the VMC rejects and the DOA boards that have been sent out by Hashfast themselves. So it is most likely that Hashfast has plenty of chips but dont have enough working boards.  But I agree with you that Hashfast is a TERRIBLE company and if you look at my comment history I have called out them out before because my camp met with them in August and they were not ethical even then. However Im not going to begrudge someone who has an entrepreneurial spirit and made something better than they did.

There are also payment processors for Litecoin so if you add it as a payment option you wont have to deal with the volatility.   Kind regards  Dear Newegg  as a large online retailer you know the benefits of technology for businesses. You probably heard in the news about digital currencies like Bitcoin and Litecoin. Especially Litecoin still has a large demand for mining rigs consisting of cheap CPUs and fast graphic cards. May I ask you to think about accepting these new currencies. You can process the payments through payment processors so you wont have to deal with volatility while still paying lower payment fees than usual.  and  more messages to bitpay and coinbase.,2014-01-25T13:49:26.000Z,0.25

1537,2.0,0,Lots of questions!  Not sure if I can answer them all but will try   gt . How long will it likely last? Cryptocurrencies seem to be the way of the future so I assume this will be a fairly long time but will there be a crash between now and say  years?  We dont know   Personally I think cryptocurrency is a game changer so itll stick around longterm.  Whether that means bitcoin itself will stick around is debatable.  And we most definitely cannot predict the value crashing or going up x.  gt . How easy is it to convert BTC into Paypal money and how long does this take? Dont need the exact steps just a rough estimate.  Very difficult.  Keep in mind that Paypal forbids currencycryptocurrency transactions so you will be in violation of their Acceptable Use Policy if go that route.  Paypal is also a common tactic for scammers looking to scam you out of both bitcoin amp dollars so be careful buyingselling with Paypal.  That said some people have mentioned using Virwox BTC gt SLL gt Paypal but the fees are supposed to be very high if you go that route.  gt . How stable is Bitcoin? Are crashes likely to happen? In a few years will the price still be roughly the same or will it have shot down? What would theoretically cause it to rise or fall?  Bitcoin is still in the early stages so its not particularly stable.  Were in the midst of a mini crash right now in fact.  But again cant predict future price.  gt . How secure would my Bitcoins be?  With bitcoin youre acting as your own bank so its a bit up to you as far as keeping them secure.  In general you want to enable two factor authentication on anything online as well as your email use strong unique passwords amp passphrases for everything.  If you use a desktop wallet be sure to use a strong passphrase.  And backup your wallet somewhere secure e.g. dont back it up to online file storage like Dropbox.  You can generally keep your bitcoin secure but you do need to think about any possible attack vectors that a hacker may exploit this unfortunately isnt all that friendly for new people jumping into bitcoin   gt . Are there any other cryptocurrencies with a brighter future than Bitcoin? If so why?  Nothing in the current crop of altcoins would make me believe they have a brighter future.  Ripple maybe but only bc of all the capital funding theyve had. then again theyre not even decentralized really so its not a good comparison to bitcoin,2014-02-07T17:58:48.000Z,0.25

1543,2.0,0,Not really sure what you are asking here. It looks like your main question is about the importance of branding. Yes the name you give crypto matters. Take memecoins for instance like doge. Its success has been largely due to branding name image etc..   Now you ask another question about the possibility that an alt overtakes bitcoin. Id really like to see what information you read that gave you the idea that this is highly likely besides just someones unfounded opinion. The nice thing about software is that another version of it can be released this happens often. If you want to work on a weakness in the protocol you can do that without making an entirely new crypto.   My confusion comes from the connection between your first and second questions.

1548,2.0,0,Actually most sites use a CC processor with a fairly generic name. Its rare that a site will handle its own CC processing.

1553,2.0,0,gtThe other cryptocurrencies suffer from the same issues of price fluctuation. Cash and the Euro fluctuate just as much as bitcoin too.   The dollar and other traditional currencies rarely fluctuate more than  on a daily basis. There is so much liquidity within currency markets so stability is there. Bitcoin moves of  or more are fairly common. Storing your hard earned money in bitcoin may be fantastic over the long term but it should be treated as a high volatile asset. If you treat a DNM vendor as a traditional business it would be silly not cash out into fiat as fast as possible unless you are hedged in some way.   Id venture to guess thats the exact reason it is used because it allows the smoothest transition to fiat compared to other cryptos.

1572,3.0,0,The features of the new currency would really have to be game changing to overcome Bitcoins network effects which are discussed elsewhere in this thread. Also keep in mind that although difficult new features can be added to Bitcoin. In terms of security Bitcoin already has  years worth of real world testing with I believe no double spends counterfeits. Im not sure how a new coin comes along and is able to shift enough users over to it without that real world testing having occurred.,2014-09-28T02:36:47.000Z,0.5
1573,3.0,1,Why?  Its true.    The worst thing about Bitcoin is the community that is sadly dominated by either rabid speculators utterly convinced that this is their unstoppable ticket to wealth or rabid technolibertarians utterly convinced this is the unstoppable deathblow to the state.  There are regular people just looking for a method of transferring payments or just interested in the idea but they get drowned out by the loons.  Its one of the biggest obstacles holding the idea back from widespread acceptance.,2014-02-28T23:18:39.000Z,0.0

Any laws congress passes that affects the internet is banned. I think thats fucked up.,2014-04-22T18:18:07.000Z,0.25
1575,3.0,0,It is true that Bitcoin lacks some of the particularly egregious security failings of various aging electronic payment systems mostly based in North America that are in dire need of replacement but it really throws the baby out with the bathwater by also not having any central authority that can as much as reverse charges. Fraud of all kind is par for the course with bitcoins and the communitys usual answer to the problem is simply caveat emptor.  That is not even touching the fundamentally intractable problem of inflation control which I was hoping would be the topic of discussion in a bitcoin thread in reconomics but ah well.  Bitcoins usefulness begins to pale really quickly in the face of any electronic payment systems remotely more advanced than those found in NA  backed by dreaded fiat currency of course like the many mobile payment systems already being enjoyed for some time now in most of Europe Asia and Africa.   Its anonymity remains its most compelling and there is no getting around the fact that this is only a priority feature for  freedom fighters which most BTC users frankly arent and  criminals.,2014-08-26T15:56:57.000Z,0.25
1576,3.0,0,haha then running namecoin is not going to be something youll want to put the effort into doing.  its a decentralized DNS and identity system meaning theres no central authority or point of failure.  it works by having a completely distributed database.  just like how a torrent file can still be sent around as long as somebody is seeding it so too can namecoin domains be accessed as long as you can connect to anybody running the namecoin software.  the database cant be hacked or changed thanks to bitcoin technology architecture for securing distributed databases via computational hashing proof of work.  in short this means that when you register a namecoin domain its yours.  it will always work and it cant be censored or stolen.  because of cryptography only YOU can change it but everybody can still read it and resolve your domain.  its both completely secure and completely peer to peer.,2014-03-18T01:59:45.000Z,0.25

1596,3.0,0,It is happening but not on the bitcoin block chain. You are correct the issue is compliance with regulations in the US these were established by Bank Secrecy Act with the travel rule and by Dodd Frank with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Both seek to tie identity to transactions so that blacklists can be cross checked and money laundering patterns identified.  Ripple is targeting this use case using a distributed consensus ledger and their open source but mostly privately developed protocol RTXP. They are integrating identity confirmation into their protocol complying with regulatory measures already on record instead of hoping Lawskey changes his mind and signing banks in Germany US France England and possibly with Earthport  a foreign exchange compliance expert.  That said XRP may never increase in value because it is currency agnostic for the function of transferring value. It is only a unit of account whose value is determined by liquidity of its builtin exchange markets currently available in about a dozen foreign exchange markets including bitcoin doge and some native IOU currencies including gold and silver.  They are presenting at Sibos swift conference starting tomorrow and at ACH payments alliance initiative event at end of October. It may end up being used by small to medium banks to eliminate inefficiencies of foreign correspondent banking which powers the top of the food chain banks on wall st.

1597,3.0,1,Have bought Dogecoin.  Its greatest potential seems to be less in the technology than in the community. Many people are now finding their way to digital cash systems by way of Dogecoin. Its a welcoming gateway.  Its also interesting that the dev team took a stand that the money supply will expand forever. It should give the Paul Krugmans of the world something interesting to write about in  years.  These kinds of things complement and add value Bitcoin which is easy to lose sight of.

Im a software engineer who develops code that hundreds of millions of users trust with their precious data. I carefully design write and test my code but I know that theres no way Ill catch all the problems. We also dont even expect our QA team to catch all the problems. We release the code and ask the community to try it out. Id say we catch  of the problems internally and the community catches the other  because they use the software in ways we didnt expect.

1605,3.0,0,Negative.    This is a unique part to Bitcoin which makes it difficult to understand because its different than anything youre use to.

I need to send   The From Address  The To Address  The Amount  All of this data again but encrypted by the Private Key  Your Private Key never touches the network.  Only the data which is encrypted by the Private Key touches the network.  Your Public Address is then used to decrypt the encrypted data and if it matches it proves you own the Private Key.  The Public and Private Keys are mathematically related.  The Private Key makes the Public Key but you cant go backwards.

1609,3.0,0,No problem and i completely understand where youre coming from. We have a complex machine learning algorithm that determines the probability that a user is purchasing bitcoin using a stolen identity. This algorithm only applies to purchasing bitcoin with dollars and not to sells or any bitcointobitcoin transactions. The price isnt a part of this algorithm as we have an equal proportion of flagged transactions when the price goes up or when the price goes down. When user purchases get flagged and the price has gone down no one really says anything because they are making money. However when user purchase is flagged and the price has gone up people complain. Again goes without saying that if you think you are wrongly accused of being high risk by all means please reach out to support.,2014-11-13T00:01:46.000Z,0.25

I have no idea where you are getting the reasonable probability that it will replace gold. Like I said earlier the only thing it has in common with gold is that it is finite at this point.

Realtime push payments are also not a bitcoin only feature.  www.Zapp.co.uk will be launching a mobile wallet in the UK soon.  As far as I can tell this will operate on a no chargeback model.

1644,3.0,0,Thats a bunch of nonesense. First of all it is not infinitely inflatable in the sense the Us dollar is. The us dollar can be infinitely inflatable in a fixed ammount of time while dogecoins inflation is fixed in stone for a set ammount of time. Second dogecoin will only be more inflatorinary than bitcoin  years from now. Third the reason it is going down is because their users have a double standard where they dont treat the coin like money but instead like some game which for some reason they find fun but at the same time they want to go to the moon so investors of course lose all confidence in such counterproductive very community.,2014-03-09T00:48:15.000Z,0.25
1645,3.0,0,gt The only people upset about inflation are the get rich quick miners and speculators.  They are being rude lately. I like the extra coins to be mined to replace the ones lost when people dont create backups of their wallets.

1647,3.0,0,I started playing around with Dogecoin a little after Christmas.  After the news of bitcoin I got interested and decided that if any scrypt coin gets to go to the moon it will be Doge.  I have been hanging around the community a little bit and I think it would be fun to make more own faucet or something to help bring more awareness to the cryptocurrency.  I even have my Raspberry Pi mining away even though it doesnt get a good hash rate.

1648,3.0,0,And remember mining isnt your only option. You may not be able to buy dogecoin directly right now but you can buy bitcoin and trade it for dogecoin on cryptsy.  can buy you a lot of doge right now and it could pay off big time down the road.

1650,3.0,0,Thanks  quick response!  gt Ultimately we are going to need cryptocurrencies that hit all major magnitudes low millions high millions and billions. We have bitcoin for our low millions magnitude M and we have Dogecoin for our billions magnitude B but Nyancoin fills a great void.  I think thats a good point that I hadnt considered the possibilities of. Of course I recognized that different magnitudes fill different economic roles in one sense such as store of value vs. transfer of value but I hadnt considered that even coins of the same basic nature different only in magnitude would be necessary.  gtAgain there will be a cat based meme coin. And this is the one.  Under that premise I agree as well. If there is going to be a catmemecoin it would probably be this one. As far as scrappy cryptos go it does have a better base than most  but that isnt saying much.  Personally I dont think I subscribe to your premise though. There will be cat coins sure there already are but that doesnt mean there will be a cat coin that the global community values. That entire category you made seems kind of suspect  not just memecoin which there dont have to be but catmeme which I dont see why there has to be either.   But just because I dont really take these categories seriously or believe that there MUST be coins for every category but then again why shouldnt there be? doesnt mean youre wrong on that point. And like I said given your premises I think youre right  if I were going to back a catmemecoin it would be this one. But why do you believe thats an essential category?  gtBut we have Nyancoin now. It doesnt look like much because just like Doge back in early December it is new and unsupported. But I know a good thing when I see it.  I figured youd bring that up and thats generally fair enough. But just because one miracle happens doesnt mean its a law that similar miracles must follow. If anything the slow momentum of nyancoin thus far provides objective reasons to reject it as a boon of growth.   Of course getting in at this level if there is any success in nyancoins stars would be as early as you can functionally get in on anything and youd suddenly become one of those bitcoin millionaires...  But for some reason I just dont see it. Im not entirely sure why I saw it with dogecoin.  Ultimately I guess it becomes a question of intuition  I know a good thing when I see it. You intuitively believe in nyancoin just as I intuitively believe in dogecoin. Maybe Ill start mining some. The intuition for me isnt there with nyan though so it just looks like a superpennystock sort of deal moreso than other microcryptos like doge do.,2014-01-26T23:41:11.000Z,0.25

1660,4.0,0,When Australia uses the term form of payment theyre referring to a form of payment to settle taxes in. Theyre looking for a country that actually accepts bitcoin for taxese.g. you can pay your taxes in bitcoin.

1662,4.0,0,With bitcoin .. released  feb  a breaking change has been included that would prevent transactions to be accepted if their signature did not include the right number of zeroes in front of the signature values in an effort to reduce risks of transaction malleability. We did not notice this change but a few of the transactions we were sending would become invalid because of this.  Am I the only one who thinks this is ridiculous to ever come out of a CEOs mouth? The man deals in bitcoin  bitcoin update brought changes  the man didnt bother to look at what was changed  piss everyone off. He is either incompetent or he is bull shitting us. I highly doubt that the largest exchange at the time of the update couldnt spare a couple of developers to read through the update. I mean cmon there are people on this subreddit who have read it and they dont even get paid to do so. In my book Mt. Gox is dead. They need to turn over everyones bitcoins no it is not okay to withheld peoples property allow to sell and finally die off. It served its purpose. It is the cocoon of this cryptobutterfly and now we must shed of it.   Edit fixed typos caused by pissed off spelling thanks Mt. Gox!!,2014-02-13T12:33:39.000Z,0.25
1663,4.0,0,nope if I have  Bitcoin on  output my transaction size is small i can use a standard miners fee to pay the Bitcoin to another address. If I have  Bitcoin  composed of m satoshis on m outputs extreme example for illustration it is worthless and unspendable. I have to sign off on all the m outputs and include them in my transaction whcih will add up to around xm bytes a lot of miners fees.  A more realistic example is this would you rather receive a Bitcoin on  output or ? A Bitcoin on one output is worth more than a Bitcoin on  outputs.,2014-05-04T14:30:09.000Z,0.25

1665,4.0,0,Thats exactly what I was trying to figure out.  So he offers a discount to bitcoin users   nothing to sneeze at.  But he is supposedly getting fraudulent chargebacks  chargebacks whose intent it is to get a product for free.  So his discount wont actually do anything but make him lose money. The people who will defraud him will defraud him and the people who use bitcoin will give him less money.  Probably wont be in business long with this business model.  EDIT Unless these chargebacks are actually legitimate chargebacks  in which case he will make one sale in bitcoin if they use it they will realize the product sucks cant get a chargeback and never buy from him again. This is all kind of loselose for his original intent.,2014-06-26T19:22:53.000Z,0.25

1668,4.0,1,SELL SELL SELL. Recover your profits. Quit catching a falling dagger. Buy back again at  minimum. Being a former trader and seeing this thread and then the charts the only people holding up the value of BTC are people like YOU in this thread. I am rapidly becoming a fan of Bitcoin and its alts but I dont buy on hysteria. I unemotionally sell. Do not buy till we see a base one thats more than  minutes or even hours long.... We WERE in a tight trading pattern but based on the short price history that is GAWN.... There may be psychological resistance at  like  kinda is playing with but long term the bottom I would estimate is near . Feel free to buy or rebuy in the high s and thank me later.  Keep watching the dead cat bounce until then. This mofo wont move drastically higher like all the baseless prophets say until the institutions decide to play. The past  points have all been profiteers. Id guess around the month of MayJuly to be optimal. Take it or leave it. I signed up to Reddit just to post this.,2014-03-28T09:57:18.000Z,0.25
1669,4.0,0,Of course it is but theres this thing called monetary policy that protects it.  Say what you want about the Federal Reserve creating money out of no where but its mandate is to control the flow of money and protect the position of The US Govt as leader of the free world.    Theres nothing behind bitcoin to say that it will retain its value.  Theres just a limited supply and a high demand.  What happens what the supply increases or demand diminishes? Theres no internal mechanism of control.,2014-01-25T20:05:27.000Z,0.25

1672,4.0,0,I had to stop watching the video and reading the comments. It just hurt my head. Im gathering it boils down to certain market economies. Asia in particular usually only accept cash as payment. Ive tried paying with credit card at global convenience stores in several developed countries and they told me the ATM is over there. Get some evil fiat if you want some beer and chips. Try that with bitcoin there and Id probably have a restraining order.,2014-12-04T14:44:35.000Z,0.25

1674,4.0,0,Bitcoins dont exist.  When someone mines bitcoin an entry is added to a distributed record the block chain which says the miners public key now has bitcoins.  Nothing is actually created so nothing gets actually transfered.  When the miner uses his private key to spend a few bitcoin to you the block chain gets updated to say that your public key now has those bitcoins.  When you create a paper wallet it just stores your private key.  Anyone can send bitcoins to the corresponding public key and that will be recorded on the block chain.  When you want to spend those bitcoins youll enter your private key somewhere and add a transaction to the block chain sending those bitcoins to someone elses public key.  Does that answer your question?,2014-04-23T02:45:48.000Z,0.25
1675,4.0,0,No worries!  Personal recommendation that helped me but I never see on this sub dont just start at the bitcoin basics if you really want to understand how it all works. Start at the absolute fundamentals of this technology go skim the Wikipedia article for public key encryption. Its fairly readable even for those with no computer science knowledge. Lots of analogies.  I tend to find that once people conceptually understand that they tend to better know the significance of their keys.

1677,4.0,0,Can someone help me by clarifying some assumptions of mine?  Ive never mined in a pool but my understanding is that pools pay miners in bitcoin.  So for example if a ghash miner solves a block ghash has to divide the block reward among its participants.  Is that correct?  How often are distributions made?  Quickly I would assume.,2014-10-07T07:55:13.000Z,0.25
1678,4.0,0,Like you say its a currency but it has some special features that other currencies dont have.  Its supposedly anonymous. You and I can transfer bitcoins to and from each others wallets without me ever knowing who you actually are and vice versa. This means its difficult to tax and difficult to track which is one reason governments are often suspicious of bitcoins.  Even though its anonymous every transaction is recorded and every member has a copy of every record. This is the block chain. When I send bitcoins to your wallet everyone using Bitcoin knows about it the transaction we made is automatically checked and if it doesnt add up it cant go through. This makes it hard to forge bitcoins or hack the system.  Bitcoins are created by solving a difficult cryptographic problem. This is called mining. Your computer chugs away for a while alone or in a network with other computers and if certain conditions are met a new bitcoin is created and assigned to you. As time goes on this problem gets harder and harder to solve so it takes more and more processing power to create each bitcoin.  There is a limited number of bitcoins that can ever exist  million. There will never supposedly be more than that but the currency will continue to be useful because it can be split into small chunks. I can own . bitcoins.  Bitcoins are important I think because theyre a currency that everyone in the world can use but no government can directly control. In theory at least.   What would you use bitcoins for? Anything youd use regular money for. You trade a bitcoin for goods or services because the person who accepts it believes they will also be able to trade that bitcoin for other goods and services.,2014-02-11T17:35:07.000Z,0.25

1681,4.0,0,Honestly I think just the biggest value in this is it reduces the value in hoarding. It doesnt do it much but it does it enough to discourage the superhoarders. And Im not sure I see how a currency can really work well if it is heavily hoarded. It leads to thinner trading and that means less price stability.  People have said Bitcoin could be useful as a media for currency exchange. If you have USD and need to pay in AUD maybe its cheapest feewise to buy Bitcoin in USD and sell it to get AUD.  But if Bitcoin is hoarded this makes the value less stable and makes it harder to acquire Bitcoin to execute this maneuver. Perhaps the noncapping of Dogecoin makes it more suitable for this purpose than Bitcoin or Litecoin.  Also I like tipping.,2014-02-05T03:22:39.000Z,0.25

Avatrade Plus Markets.com FXChoice Forex Metal Bitx and eToro offer Bitcoin CFDs.

In Bitcoin land there has been so much growth that virtually everyone you encounter is just slightly less new than you even some of people that are becoming famous here as Bitcoin experts are new since .

1701,5.0,0,I would be of the opinion that bitcoin feeds a desire for risk that some people are born with. Just holding it allows someone to gamble  and feed their craving to take chances. Then you have the aspect of buying shady goods with it hoping you dont get busted or ripped off more feeding of the risk desires. To some it might sound crazy but some people really enjoy a period of risk which culminates in celebration of success or depression of failure. Some people visit prostitutes and risk STDs to feed their need for risk. Im not saying all this to be trolly or imply that bitcoin is a bad thing the idea that bitcoin feeds some peoples psychological needs has always fascinated me. Im fond of dating women in the psych profession and somewhat narcissistic myself so I feel completely qualified to make this assessment of the community.,2014-08-07T13:45:37.000Z,0.25
1702,5.0,0,gtI realized that the only reason why bitcoin was valued at  was Mtgox and their manipulation   Did you read the article that proved that Mt Gox was manipulating the price? Theyre basically the reason it ever got above the low hundreds and it never came down after presumably because so many people bought in at that price and refuse to realise their losses.   People on rbitcoin claim you should always buy on the fundamentals but if you were to do that youd be looking at paying  for one at most.   Imagine if I offered you a debit card that only worked for Newegg Overstock Tiger Direct and a few thousand sites youve never heard of. And you can only withdraw money from  or so ATMs that are placed all over the world. But you can buy drugs with the debit card.   Thats what bitcoin essentially is. Itd be completely worthless without the black market which is its killer app. No one would take any interest at all until you mentioned the drug buying capabilities.   Its really weird how much Butters attempt to distance themselves from their killer app. Bringing up the darkmarkets makes their buttholes pucker.,2014-07-12T08:58:32.000Z,0.25
1703,5.0,0,Not even close actually... Maybe once Bitcoin options actually become established but potential returns currently rest far far far in traditional options strategies.  For example a bet that AAPL will jump massively after earnings this last quarter by holding monthly AAPL  out of the money calls would have netted you  return in just  days in mid april. On that day they announced a much anticipated stock split... seeing that and buying into effectively the same position with June expiration  out of the money calls would have provided an additional  return as of today.  Even if you were to take a much less speculative bet that AAPL will make a big move after earnings you could still earn  if it made a large move either direction something it often does after earnings because it is very secretive about its own earnings beforehand.  You just cant compete with option strategies as far as raw returns or even tuning risk vs. reward... of course thats main thing that makes them extremely dangerous many first timers use them to take on too much risk just because they are gambling rather than investing and are starstruck by the awesome potential returns.,2014-05-31T16:28:53.000Z,0.25

1721,6.0,0,I dont know any resource in particular but can give a few tips from experience   block outbound connections  This severely handicaps what malware can do once installed. Most firewalls including iptables have options to allow established connections but deny new ones initiated from the server. Only grant egress access to what is absolutely necessary. Im surprised that very few people do this.   dont allow the web server user write access to the file system  Its been a long while since I last ran Wordpress so not sure if this is applicable. Make sure writable filesystems are mounted noexec however this does not stop the attacker from running scripts through an interpreter such as PHP or perl.   chroot the application  Create a chroot without any dangerous binaries such as perl or if you are using FPM phpcli. Also consider containers though most preconfigured container images are actually full Linux installations so the same precautions apply.   detect driveby attacks and script kiddies  There are security modules for nginx and varnish that will detect common attack patterns and execute arbitrary actions.  These steps wont help much towards securing the application itself i.e. from SQL or other injections but decreases the chance of your server becoming a bitcoin mining rig considerably.,2014-11-15T01:00:18.000Z,0.25

1724,6.0,0,Bitcoin isnt a person. Its a network a protocol. Personifying it isnt going to get you very far in the end. It doesnt want to achieve anything.    Ask ten different people what they want Bitcoin to achieve and youll get ten different and unique answers.    With that said what is it potentially capable of achieving? To name a few things a virtually unimpeachable and objective public ledger that allocates and preserves the location of wealthvalue in a fair manner. A borderless asset that cannot be arbitrarily redefined by a particular nation. A means of transmission wherein two remote parties can exchange value without dealing with a third party. A money protocol wherein the units can be subdivided virtually infinitely. A platform from which things like trustless escrow and microtransactions can spring. What Bitcoin aims to achieve is what Bitcoin is.   What market cap does it have the potential of reaching? Tough to say at such an early stage. Id say more than  billion easily. Anything more precise than that would be a random guess though.    By the way I think you grossly overestimate the feasibility of a  attack actual victimizing someone with a doublespend.

Proven to have lied about the reasons behind Mt Goxs payment delays hes now suspected of mishandling the funds.  Charlie Shrem cofounder of BitInstant  his easytouse Bitcoin exchange service was always criticised for its capricious changes and cancellations of orders. Later arrested for deliberately helping a Silk Road dealer skirt BitInstants legally mandated antimoneylaundering regulations the ones he was tasked with enforcing. Even after this comes out his reputation was still good enough for many on rbitcoin to listen when he vouched for Mt Goxs solvency a statement he later admitted he made without evidence.  And now Tony Gallippi CEO of Bitpay the most popular service for merchants who want to add BTC as a payment option.

1754,8.0,0,In what sense do the fundamentals look good?    Bitcoin is functionally identical and in many ways inferior to other crypto currencies.

Just to name a few.   Merchant adoption is up actual use as a currency appears to be lagging though data is admittedly bad.  ACH reform  Xoom in the US would fairly easily eliminate most use cases for Bitcoin.  Of course lets be honest Bitcoin proponents arent about fundamentals or legitimate use cases for the currency. Theyre looking for a currency to evade governments.

1755,8.0,0,Youre impressed with the Zeus because youre comparing its specs to mining with GPUs today but ASICs will change the landscape entirely. Within a few generations of ASICs your Zeus will be the equivalent of mining Doge with CPUs today. That could be a timeline of as short as a few months if you look at the rapid evolution of Bitcoin ASICs.  The corollary is that Vertcoin will most likely see a massive influx of GPU miners as ASICs become more and more prevalent. So any profitability calculations you do now wont mean anything not that they mean much to begin with seeing how quickly they change hour by hour. Ultimately your profits and everybody elses profits will continue to go down at an accelerated rate unless you pay for more equipment to stay where you are.  You might want to switch to Vertcoin if you believe the coins fundamentals developers and community will continue to add value. In that case you would mine and hold the coin while the difficulty is still relatively low. Youd also want to become an active member of the community and do what you can to encourage widespread acceptance because that will ultimately increase the value of the coins you hold. So even though you will inevitably be mining fewer and fewer coins they will be worth more and more. Many Vertans hold this long term view and are less concerned about the immediate profitability.,2014-04-07T13:54:00.000Z,0.25

1759,9.0,0,Ive been thinking about how to contribute to decentralize mining. I wanted to buy one of those small USB miners and run it on my computer just to help with the decentralization and not to make a large profit. I would actually even accept a smaller loss in doing this just to contribute to decentralization.  But people have told me that my approach would be very ineffective because my contribution would be so small that it would essentially be insignificant. So I never bought any USB miner.  But buying a share in a company that does everything for me seems easy and effective. They would do all the hardware upgrades and I would probably loose only a little not really caring for profit from mining but would make an effective contribution  USD in decentralizing the mining that the bitcoin network is so dependent upon.  So why would I accept a small net loss in doing this mining? Well simply because if enough people would do the same then mining decentralization would not be a problem and I would be able to sleep better at night not worrying about the future value of my cold wallet bitcoins.  So what would happen if more than   of people who mine would use Petamine to do their mining for them? Wouldnt that introduce another single point of failure no matter whether or not Petamine uses this ppool kind of mining that I dont actually understand? Couldnt a government seize all of Petamines operations since Petamine would have all their hardware in the same place? Whats the big deal that they join ppool or however that should be written?  So whats the best way for me to just throw some small amount of money at the problem Lets say  USD worth of bitcoin? Should I throw it at Petamine because they are a relatively small player and then throw another  USD worth of bitcoin at a different mining company a year from now when Petamine has grown too large? Whats the benefit of waiting to throw some money on them until theyve done their ppool thing as opposed to throwing the money right now?

Edit Also dont buy BitCoin or commodities. Fuck BitCoin. Dont buy commodities unless you know what youre doing. Fuck commodities except as a way of hedging or adding diversification. BitCoin and commodities do not pay interest or dividends and so they do not benefit from the compound interest that stocks and bonds can that is the real basis for long term wealth creation. In the very long term they should roughly track inflation as opposed to growthinflation like stocks or inflationrisk free raterisk premiumdefaults for bonds. Plus BitCoin in particular carries a tremendous amount of risk relating to its structure and whether people will choose to accept it and commodities carry storage costs either you pay it or you pay someone else for it via expense ratios without getting paid interestdividends to compensate.  Double edit If you want to do k just use k and k as your numbers to invest with.

1784,12.0,0,I almost forgot to add the extra comment I mentioned in the parent    Granted there are times the bot seems to be painting the tape to keep the last trade price at the top or the bottom of the spread and certainly this could be part of a larger strategy to goad the market into thinking the price is undergoing a steady predictable climb burning all the short positions who were confident the trend was headed down or fall  so the botowner knowing she can yank the bot out any time can set up a nearly riskfree counter position to snare unsuspecting momentum and swing traders.    But the problem with this theory is that the bot often doesnt seem to be acting in its own best interest since it sometimes runs at the rate of one trade every several seconds and can keep this up for several hours at a stretch costing it more than  per hour  even when being beaten back by a countertrading bot doing the opposite trades or after being smacked down with a whale salebuy that negates all of its stationkeeping work.    Well so what BlockchainofFools maybe the bot owner is a Bitcoin Honeybadger millionaire balla who can brush off a few tens of thousands of losses? Well maybe but I dont think it is realistic to assume that a successful and sophisticated trader capable of amassing those millions before bitcoin came on the scene thus who would be quite capable of making money the old fashioned way without help from bitcoin would deliberately take an approach that under typical market conditions loses money as often as not. Running such a bot like that for just three hours would cost about  in purchases assuming a tranquil market with no other interfering actors taking advatnage of your extremely predictable bot behavior and would be making all purchases being made at the top or if sells sold at the bottom of the spread  the least profitable place to do so and one which guarantees you will lose money if the market does not go much further in the direction you are trying to send it once you turn the bot off.    Yeah but  maybe they knew it as going there and wanted to amplify the trend for their own gain Still doesnt pencil out if they knew the market was going to hit or at least come close to hitting target price X in the first place why risk tying up or even losing all the money used to fund the bot when you could just wait for the market to approach the target price and strike  where it will be much more profitable?    Also Id like to add that even if exchanges are running these bots themselves it doesnt rule out people trying to copy this strategy or counteract it but I believe this is an even less believable scenario because the counteracting bot always starts off with a big disadvantage since it is not pushing forth its own profit strategy but only blocking the other bot defensively a bot which it has no way of knowing the strategy of leaving the defense bot open to being manipulated into awful losses unless its owner is hovering over it non stop... which largely defeats the point of having a bot.  tldr  drip bots dont make economic sense for regular noninside traders so its unlikely they are run by them.,2014-01-19T20:32:03.000Z,0.0

1816,90.0,0,From IEEE Spectrum  Heres what a terrible week looks like in the world of Bitcoin Two of the most trafficked Bitcoin exchanges Mt. Gox and Bitstamp temporarily halt trading and suspend bitcoin withdrawals in the midst of a distributed denial of service attack DDoS. On exchanges that are still open for business the value of the currency takes a brutal sudden hit and then continues to tumble. Bitcoin users notice strange errors in their wallet balances after making routine transactions. Rumor spreads that the Bitcoin protocol is critically flawed. And where rumor is lacking conspiracy theories abound.  All this and its barely Thursday.  Some of it is true. Some of it is half true. Some of it is completely false. Here is whats really going on.  Mt. Gox which until recently was the most trafficked of the Bitcoin exchanges is at the center of this mess. Whether they actually caused it is a separate question and still up for debate. Either way theyve been in the Bitcoin doghouse for at least a year now during which time they have been reliably generating bad Bitcoin press. Many traders who frequent the online exchange choose to leave some of their money both bitcoin and fiat in an account set up by the company. Keeping the money on site allows clients to do quick trades but people are beginning to wonder whether Mt. Gox can be trusted to be responsible with the funds they have.  Last Mayconfidence was shaken by the news that the Department of Homeland Security had seized the Dwolla epayments account of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles and accused him of operating without the proper license. After the loss of this currency conduit customers began reporting long delays withdrawing dollars from their Mt. Gox accounts. Poor communication fomented a deep mistrust in the exchange and people began to wonder whether Mt. Gox might have squandered its clients money. And now as of last Friday Mt. Gox customers cant even withdraw bitcoins.  In a statement on its website Mt. Gox claimed that it had identified a serious flaw in the Bitcoin protocol one that behooved it to cease transactions until developers could find a solution. Conspiracy theories immediately followed. Several people implored Mt. Gox to somehow verify the solvency of their exchange. One guy even staked out the office in Japan to confront Karpeles himself. But the mob lowered its pitchforks after core Bitcoin developers announced that the flaw Mt. Gox outlined does indeed exist. Its called transaction malleability and according to Bitcoin developers it does need to be fixed.  Generally malleability is a design flaw in Bitcoin albeit a very subtle one. So we can forgive Satoshi for overlooking it says Mike Hearn a developer who works on the Bitocin protocol. Satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonym for the inventor of the Bitcoin protocol.  In order to understand transaction malleability you need to know that the balances of all Bitcoin addresses are maintained on a public ledger and that the changes made to this ledger are what constitute the transfer of funds.  When a transaction is broadcast to the network it is relayed with a digital fingerprint that identifies it. Bitcoin miners then scoop it up verify it and send it on to the rest of the network for confirmation. Once the transaction has been confirmed there is no way for that same person to spend those same bitcoins because they are being checked against the public ledger.  The malleability feature allows a person to intervene right after the transaction request has been sent modify the fingerprint and create a duplicate transaction. So now you have two unconfirmed transactions flying around the network. They are both for the exact same payment but they have different fingerprints and only one of them can be added to the public ledger. The first one that is confirmed will be accounted for in the blockchain and will become the definitive record says Andreas Antonopoulos the chief security officer for the Blockchain.info Bitcoin wallet. The other will be dropped as a double spend attempt.  Its when the mutated version gets added that we start to have problems. It turns out that when Mt. Gox needs to verify that a transaction has gone through it scans the public ledger for confirmations on the fingerprint that the transaction generated. If its software doesnt see it it assumes that the payment was not successfully sent. There are other more reliable ways to set up the accounting but from the little explanation Mt. Gox has given this seems to be how its running its operation.  Using transaction malleability it seems that some Mt. Gox customers were able to pull off a version of refund fraud says Antonopoulos. Mt. Gox is claiming that some customers requested a bitcoin transaction and were able to quickly change the fingerprint on the transaction making it looks like it hadnt gone through. When they returned to Mt. Gox to complain the exchange would agree to send payment again.  But its not just a headache for the exchanges. Malleability can also cause problems for people who conduct multiple Bitcoin transactions in rapid succession causing some transactions to be voided and wallet balances to get out of sync with whats reflected in the network. In essence however this is an accounting problem. It is not possible to use this flaw to steal or misdirect Bitcoins that you do not own.  What these are are phantom transactions that dont effect the balance but can fool your wallet into thinking that it has less than it haswhich is scary but harmless says Antonopoulos.  If you are using Bitcoin right now its quite possible that this will effect you. Shortly after Mt. Gox shined a spotlight on the problem someone rushed to capitalize on it. The whole network is now experiencing a massive DDoS attack from a collection of rogue nodes that are working to change transaction fingerprints.  Every wallet will deal with this differently. Antonopouloss Blockchain.info wallet which Apple just yanked from the iOS app store interprets the event as a double spend attempt and alerts users accordingly. But in all cases the effects can be mitigated by simply waiting ten minutes between each payment.  Hearn says that coming up with a complete fix is a longterm goal. In the meantime exchanges will have to change their implementation to account for mutated transactionssomething which some exchanges already do. Antonopoulos says he expects Bitstamp to be up and running by next week.  It will be very interesting to see what happens when Mt. Gox reopens. With all of the mischief theyve created and illwill theyve inspired a lot of people are going to be looking to get out as soon as they have the chance and I expect them to do everything they can to avoid a bank run.  They have to handle their return path very carefully says Antonopoulos. Theyve burnt the credibility that would give them enough breathing room to do it right.  But when it comes to the Bitcoin protocol and the currency itself Antonopoulos is not worried at all. In fact he says attacks make it more resilient.  TLDR DDOS attacks follow trading suspension after bitcoin flaw allows people to spend and then claim refund.,2014-02-15T08:35:52.000Z,0.25

1832,34.0,0,Bitcoin being valued higher is integral to many things   Mining rewards go up increasing hashrate and network security   Creates liquidity which is very important for some of the larger companies to step in. e.g. theres not enough liquidity and trading happening for Amazon or a large bank to rely on bitcoin   Reduces volatility. A market cap of k can easily be manipulated by dropping a few thousand bucks. A b market cap is much harder to manipulate. It doesnt remove volatility but reduces it.   A large market cap e.g. b means professional traders join in who have professional news sources. It means a large amount of bitcoin would be held by people who wont panic sell as much as an individual without professional marketregulatory information and his mortgage on the line will. It also means youve got enough liquidity for financial parties to start to develop risk instruments like hedging which can reduce volatility and allow individuals and companies to insure against risk at a cost.   Creates new media attention and can dampen the voices of those who keep screaming this time its dead.   Percentage fees create bigger market opportunities for new businesses   Early adopters who hold bitcoin and become wealthy and dont sell are incentivized to build up the bitcoin ecosystem through investing exchanges payment processors ATMs wallets. Many early bitcoin services were financed this way. If the ecosystem thrives their remaining bitcoin holdings thrive too.  I can go on and on.

One might say why do the holdersusers of those alternatives not choose the most popular.

Although Bitcoin is popular in its tiny community of enthusiasts it is an insignificant percentage of the population at large and also an insignificant number compared to GoogleAmazon customer base.  IF someone like Google started their own crypto they could design it to have fewer defects and more attractive features tailored to their customers they could offer securityinsurance for their own crypto they can promote it for virtually zero cost and I suspect that in a very short time period if their customers like it the user base would be higher than Bitcoin. They may not care very much if it does not get wider use outside GoogleAmazon to start with but if it does take off they can form alliances with other large companies who could use their coin.

This has happened before with other exchanges.  correct its more probable that BTCe will screw people over than it is that the US gov will posion the entire nation with nerve gas.  however you still have no evidence to support the idea that BTCe will do that its just more likely than my random made up insane scenario.  within the realm of what might be considered a reasonable probability for it to occur being a bitcoin exchange and under  years old its on the low end.  that same probability may be on the high end for older more established traditional banks.  but the point is for the business they are in they have the best reputation that its possible for them to have.  could they go under?  yes.  but your reason for thinking that they might is entirely speculation based on no facts or reasoning whatsoever.  .  gt And that history says They have been hacked and they dont even know why or are lying about it.  ...  Because they dont know how they were hacked. They gave an explanation that is impossible.  they dont know how part of the hack was accomplished but they know exactly what it was how it affected them and how to fix it.  the hack was an API key was compromised.  they revoked it rolled back the trades done via that API that werent already cashed out refunded user balances from trades that were cashed out and generated a new more secure longer key and put in stricter restrictions on accessing it.  in short they did a good job managing the problem as soon as it cropped up.  what the fuck else do you want from them?,2014-04-24T04:51:25.000Z,0.25

Plus email addresses dont require identity checks  gt Also the blockchain that bitcoin uses is public so there is some possibility of tracing the person who made the payment?  Well potentially but if you use new addresses every time you can mitigate a lot of that.  Also since bitcoin payments are final the VPN has no need to keep any information about the payment except where required by law so theres no need for the VPN to associate the payment address with the account.  Theres still potential for identities being unmasked but its magnitudes lower than the certainty of revealing your identity with credit cards.  gt A VPN can similarly be strongarmed into surrendering their SSL keys to governments and with a legal gag you would be non the wiser. Then any future or recorded traffic could be decrypted.  Thats true.  But remember that across country lines jurisdiction can get messy.  gt There is a Myriad of issues with trusting VPNs with your privacy. By far the most worrying is that even the most trustworthy of VPN operators can be flipped by government under penalty of jail time should the not cooperate.

Oh theres no problem thanks for the info.    days later  check cleared and I still have no idea who or what it was for.   On another day in Sheffield I was walking towards what looked like an argument on a residential street lots of belongings trashed on the street and in a garden probably someone being kicked out this was nighttime.  As I was got closer I saw something on the low brick wall looked like a kids paint set small rectangular shining in the moonlight something told me to pick it up.

1937,1.0,0,"First of all my sincerest apologies for the late reply.  I was in the air all day yesterday and suffered an asthma attack to boot! Anyway I find your first point quite interesting.   To describe wars as a capitalist thing seems strange not only were they common features of precapitalist societies and even in a sense were existent before civilization itself formed in the case of tribal conflicts and so on.  Socialist countries especially China and Russia themselves came very very close to war arguably only avoided because that would make them weak to Western attack.    In addition the argument that WW started because capitalism influenced its immediate factors is absolutely untrue.   The Serbian question and indeed the heart of the AustroHungarian situation which triggered the war was the fault of the various ethnic and religious faultlines of the Empire.  In Germany too conflicts with France were part of a long series of wars that had begun centuries earlier.   Certain Capitalist interests had profited off of some of this myriad patchwork of alliances and conflicts though thats a stupid point because in a capitalist society people can make money off of everything not just bad things but in general tariffs and border controls hindered business more than anything.    Far more than any other factor WW was a nationalist conflict and as we know Nationalism can existed in societies of all types.   Indeed Nationalism is an impediment to capitalism and globalisation which is why most capitalist interests are not happy about the prospect of leaving Europe.  Contrary to some of the information you may have seen Germany was not close to Marxist revolution in .  Socialism was a powerful force in politics at the time certainly but the risk of Marxists coming into power across Europe and indeed the world is MASSIVELY overstated I literally did a Semester on this at University.  Leftist groups and trade unionists who did gain power in many countries were only very rarely for the full Marxist program and often just wanted better labour laws nationalisation of key industries and government job creation programs.   In the First World War the Kaiser was not actually especially scared of Communists though he did dislike the social democrats but rather was unwilling to give way to a full constitutional democracy and thought a quick war would cement his power.  Your second point is based on an even more interesting pont in my opinion.  You suggest corruption is inherent in purely hierarchical societies and that the state inherently furthers its own interests both suggestions with which I would agree wholeheartedly.   I and most other Conservatives see the state as an unfortunate necessity to be watched doubted and restricted and every turn.   Someone must find rapists murderers and criminals as well as those who invade others property and administer our justice to hold them to account and something must defend us against less free societies and leaders who wish to attack us from abroad.  With very few exceptions that is all a capitalist want the government to do.  Even a central bank or federal reserve is unnecessary if money is backed by gold and everything else may be handled nonhierarchically by individuals and private interests. An anarchist society by contrast cannot function without an extremely powerful state.   As there is not an unlimited supply of goods energy land and resources their distribution must be regulated.  In a capitalist society financial instruments ie money and a very basic set of property rights that can be enforced by a small group of people allow for efficient distribution of said resources.  In an anarchist society  either these goods are given to everyone in equal measure I dont want a trampoline you dont want an xbox they are given freely I take more food than I need more land than I need and more power than I need just because I can or they are allocated based on various factors by a central authority which sits hierarchically atop the distribution chain i.e. a state. The second problem in an anarchist society is that banning capitalist trade and employment is a task that would require a Stasilike volume of secret police infiltration and state controlsurveillance.  If I give Bob  of my chickens this year in return for  of his tomato crop next year thats me investing in his business and thus profiting off his labour.   If Sam gives Jerry  bushels of wheat for helping him catch lb of tuna this year and then trades that tuna for  bushels of wheat on the black market Sam is in Marxs eyes a capitalist. In order to stop capitalism cropping up to prevent private trade to prevent employment of labour for profit and to prevent the development of private currency which in the age of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin is almost impossible anyway a colossal surveillance effort would be needed with neighbours informing on neighbours and a huge central control operation probably with hierarchical structure to boot.  If I set up a little capitalist state within your anarchist one whose going to come in with guns and pitchforks and shut me down?  An army? Whose?  And under centralised hierarchical control?",2014-06-22T16:26:23.000Z,0.25

1946,1.0,0,Either that or maybe hell kinda be like the Bitcoin creator who we dont even know that much about.  Make the coin fade into the ether.  Or in his case I think hes holding a bunch of it and slowly selling it as needed to finance himself.    There are a lot of people who win the lottery and hate that by winning they have the right to announce your name and stuff.  You get relatives calling you that you never knew etc.  Sometimes if you can appear do something good make money on it and then just walk away is the best thing you can do.  And then again there are some people who cant just stand the spotlight like me.  If some celeb has stolen my  minutes they are more than welcome to it.  I could never handle being in the spotlight.,2014-02-09T21:54:53.000Z,0.5
1947,1.0,0,Gold is a multipurpose material with a historical and modern relation to money and wealth.  Bitcoin is an experiment that went really really well and is paving the way to a paperless money. Its far too early to call Bitcoin Gold .. Bitcoin must first replace money on a wide scale before even having a chance of being called the successor to gold.  Silver probably has a better chance of becoming Gold . what with the fact that it has many more future and modern uses than gold. Plus it already has thousands of years of use as money on Bitcoin.  In all seriousness though  I doubt Bitcoin in its current form has the ability to dethrone gold.

1967,1.0,0,Hold on that doesnt add up. Gold mining DOES create new money or it doesnt?   If theres no new money creation in the game its much harder work for new players to get any compared to the loaded players who were there for a cut on day .  Thats exacerbated by deflation  because it becomes even HARDER to move the balance of wealth away from older players as their buying power naturally increases  even then not considering the fact items arent destroyed.  In the real world people might join Bitcoin after the initial stage because there is still an asset USD it is appreciating rapidly against. In a video game theyre gonna want an economical model that doesnt enslave them to Day  players or theyll choose a different game.,2014-02-23T20:35:15.000Z,0.25

Someone that smart has to know that you will be found eventually. They eventually found Osama Bin Laden. If he was paranoid enough to mask his emails etc I would think it would follow that he would be paranoid enough to assume someone was going to find him and that he would need to secure himself physically ie. not be in a random CA neighborhood with your Corrola parked in the driveway. Or maybe he is just that eccentric? All I know is the man the reporter called out is in immediate physical danger and I hope he has already gotten the hell out of there.,2014-03-06T16:16:47.000Z,0.25

1977,1.0,0,Think of it this way  When a dollar is created it has to be paid back with interest  To pay the interest on the first dollar another dollar must be created which again must be paid back with interest  That ends up in a situation in which there will always be more debt than there is money.  Bitcoins are not debt when they are created so it avoids this scenario of ever growing debt. Thus perpetually growing debt is not a feature of the bitcoin system. Money can still be borrowed of course but there is nothing wrong with that. What is wrong is a system that was designed to eventually collapse.,2014-08-24T23:33:31.000Z,0.25

1985,1.0,0,No its blocks of  so that you can backup it up and that backup is good for up to  transactions going forward. What does that mean? It means a new wallet will have  unused keys. You do  transactions and maybe  addresses have been used up and now you have  unused keys. You do  transactions and now youve used up all your keys. On your very next transaction or when you next ask for a new address it will generate  keys to fill the pool again. If your wallet is encrypted it will ask for the password so that it can write the news keys to the wallet file.  FYI  is the default size of the key pool but you can change it to an arbitrary number if you create a config file. See the bitcoin wiki  en.bitcoin.it for more details.   Edit turns out Im wrong.

Try this I write a program to create individual wallets for every Filipino citizen theres about M of them.  I take BTC and divide it equally among each wallet so each person gets  satoshi.  I then send everyone access to their newly created wallets.  Assume for the purposes of this example that  no filipino uses bitcoin and  everyone excitedly goes online and accepts their newly created wallet.  Ive just increased the adoption of BTC usage from me  person to M people this is actually a much larger increase than you required.  Please paint me a picture why the price would suddenly increase in this scenario?  No additional wealth has been put into BTC but the user base has been expanded.,2014-09-10T20:58:02.000Z,0.25

2040,1.0,0,Your question doesnt make a huge amount of sense if you cant convince anyone to give you dollars youre unlikely to be able to convince them to give you euros or yen or bitcoin. Its all the same thing  asking people for money and them not wanting to give it to you.  And why would they? Youre not collecting for a charity or a good cause just for your own financial benefit. Youre saying that a  might go to a charity but if thats what I want to get done I can just give money directly to that charity and then I get to pick the organisation and they get  of my donation. The only thing youre adding to the process is a selfserving middleman whos planning on taking a substantial cut of the proceeds.  Maybe youre thinking that your education is a good cause... and for you personally Im sure it is but a charitable organisation dedicated to helping people pay their tuition costs would be helping many people and almost certainly applying some sort of meanstesting and meritocracy to ensure that were donating to help those who are in some way deserving not just those who make the loudest noise on social media.  To sum up the magic internet money properties of bitcoin might slightly reduce the friction involved in throwing pennies at you in a way thats not really easy to do with ordinary currency but youre still not offering anyone a compelling reason to part with their money.

He is an adult and he can make whatever decisions he wants.   I myself still have great faith that the market cap will go up significantly. You can call it gambling if you want but thats your opinion.   I am not here to give qualified financial advice and I never even told him to buy anything. He just asked me where he can. Whatever happens will be due to his research and opinions.   Satoshi has never moved any of his coins. And besides it seems to me that he deserves some sort of reward for inventing a protocol which efficiently and transparently achieves that which industries and layers of bureaucracy fail to.   The reason why the public remains unconvinced is because they have not yet taken the time to read about it. The vast majority of negative press comes from arguments which are actually category errors when it comes to Bitcoin. How can Satoshi have profited if he has never moved any coins?   If other people profited then they deserve it they made an investment into something that nearly everyone considers stupid and turned out to be right. Paradoxically the same people who called those early adopters stupid now call them lucky.   PS You seem genuinely against BTC from your post history. What is it that is bothering you?

2059,1.0,0,In summary Ive said that there is an ongoing flaw in a poorly manufactured financial vehicle MtGox and that other poorly manufactured financial vehicles are subject to this same problem resulting in people losing their money.  Youre saying that because I have not yet identified any vehicle other than MtGox with this problem that everyone should continue about their business without taking any additional precautions.  Says Paul Revere The British are coming! The British are coming!  Says Palehorse Well he only saw one so I think we should just all relax. Until we actually see more there is really no reason to get all alarmed now is there?  Seriously? If I were reporting for say a university classroom or dealing with a legal brief then I would have reported this story differently. As it sits now people need to take note. Youre completely ignoring whats happening with MtGox essentially recommending that I go all purist and encourage people to ignore the obvious shortcomings of second rate exchanges.  If you choose to believe that MtGox is or has been the only exchange with this problem thats your business but selling it to anyone else is just bad advice. Worse its poor form to encourage others to take unnecessary risks with a developing technology by ignoring potential pitfalls or shortcomings that can cost them their investments. I fully support Bitcoin and believe that part of that support is in making sure that others arent duped by places like MtGox.  Forewarned is forearmed. In this case Id rather trust my clear common sense observation that if one of the largest and most trusted exchanges out there just took a dump on their customers that there are most certainly other less professional  not observing proper security protocols exchanges also flying by the seat of their pants.,2014-02-11T19:40:36.000Z,0.25

I understand that its not a  satisfactory term but to the average person its short and catchy and is already a colloquial word for units of currency.  Im just glad that an easy common term for the microbitcoin has taken hold because I believe those ridiculous strings of decimal places were really holding things back  they were both confusing and psychologically deflating.

But lets say there is a service that keeps a transaction of all your BTC to another wallet that belongs to you whose private key is not on your phone.  A simpler solution to the same problem is to have a backup of your phone wallet on some other device. Then if your phone gets stolen you can transfer the bitcoin out of that wallet as soon as you have access to that backup copy.  Even more powerful is to have your phone wallet also be a brain wallet. Then even if youre traveling or whatever as soon as you can use a device with a bitcoin client on it you can send the bitcoin to a safe place.

I think exploring other mechanisms except SHA proof of work to secure the network is essential. Its obvious to me that Bitcoin must evolve or eventually be replaced and altcoins are a great place to experiment with that process of evolution. The thing that a lot of people miss is that for most altcoins if they become a major competitor to Bitcoin Bitcoin can always copypaste the codefeatures that make that altcoin standout. Im still in favor of fundinginvesting in altcoins because More Power to Crypto.   Weve seen a literal explosion of altcoins and its become really hard to distinguish the real innovation from the fluff. I dont think that any altcoin warrants a keynote position in a conference ... theyre interesting as a talk or a panel or a few but certainly not keynote.  . Bitcoin is not seen as associated  disassociated with any country  its a neutral phenomenon more neutral than even the internet.

Do not convert your bitcoin and you do not need to invest it in USD. It is not considered profit until it is converted into USD.   I think the wording is fine and isnt the most damning although obviously not ideal. May require rewording to clarify that that will remain the case.  The most damning I believe is the implicit requirement of a BitLicense for all users of second generation cryptocurrencies that are not exempt due to the purchasing of goods and services provision e.g. if you use Ether to fuel Ethereum contracts or DApps you would appear to not have such an exemption.,2014-07-20T15:06:30.000Z,0.0

I have used coinbase.com for as long as I can remember due to its simplicity and ease of use so forgive my lack of knowledge for all the various bitcoin wallets but even with the private key I cant seem to find a proper way to import it anywhere and actually use it.

You can link this to an api of an exchange so that everything gets sold immediately for bitcoin if you only want fiat. Why do merchants not do this? Well they probably arent that familiar with bitcoin and when you use a third party you can of course shift the responsibility to them.

I never understood why anyone would maintain a significant balance on a rd party service where the rd party held the private key. Thats no difference to holding cash in a bank except with cryptos there are no regulations to protect you when that rd party goes belly up.  The correct way to do bitcoin is to keep your own coins. Encrypted hot wallet cold storage whatever. Be your own bank.  This is why I dont think btc can ever become mass market.

Very high risk investment many peoples fantasy dream of bitcoin price going to   per bitcoin   . Virtual payment platform. All you need here is relative price stability over a very short period of time. You want to transfer  million now to Australia from the US. You want to go in with  million and deliver  million in Australia preferably instantaneously and at extremely low cost. What do you need to do this fantastic technological infrastructure  safe very liquid very large and very quick market.   If the technological infrastructure described above is in place then the actual price level of bitcoin is  immaterial. You can do it at the bitcoin price at  or  . What you need is complete price stability while you are on the platform making the transfer.   That is what would be great in Argentina or anywhere else.  So a bitcoin exchange in Argentina is about the platform not the high risk investment part of bitcoin. The same goes for Venezuela.,2014-07-31T11:22:25.000Z,0.25

I guess if they did try to ban bitcoin as such they would have to ban all cryptos.

But still defining it on paper would be We the govt ban all publically held and distributed ledgers. Which how the hell could they manage that... But in light of recent events in the world who knows they could.   With its current adoptions and market cap in USD I dont think they could do such a thing.

2166,1.0,0,Two things. First the decision on who will be next and only super power is coming. The American Empire is going to essentially go into a spending war against China. Cold War . most of these proxy wars will be fought in Africa and EurAsia. Who produces and one ups each other technologybased and militarily will win.   This will probably be challenged by bitcoin and the environment global climate change and decentralization.   Secondly from friends in the military who I have discussed the ai replacement. The conscious right now is that it is coming however the pentagon doesnt like the excessive force the isolation of drones provide. The combat effectiveness is also in question because of lack of mobility senses and sight. Being there your training kicks in being there through a robot makes it harder to assess the situation.   No one can out spend America and no one can out grow China this will probably be both of their down falls. Sure a BRIC nation might jump in the ring but they dont have the influence yet.

Eventually the internet may be developed to allow communism to work. Technology like bitcoin is a great step forward. We dont have that sort of universal tracking ability yetbitcoin for example can only handle a few transactions per second despite having a massive amount of computing power. Its a technical problem.  gtSounds like some silly problem youve learned in econ  from people who dont want you to think about anything but the status quo.  The shoe problem is of deciding how much people need. In the capitalist system people want food and luxury shoes but they can only afford food. Because there isnt enough people buying luxury shoes people avoid manufacturing shoes make food instead. In a command economy the government has to guess how much food and how much shoes people need. The government cant know nearly as much and respond nearly as fast as a market can.   Short of a technological breakthrough as Ive said theres no easy solution. A market without regulations cant deal with externalities. However the government doesnt have natural selection pruning it down and cant respond to shortages and oversupplies easily.,2014-08-12T04:29:40.000Z,0.25
2175,1.0,0,The main risk in importing and not sweeping is that someone with previous access to the private key can pay you at some point in the future. Instead of the address you give the attacker sends bitcoin to the address you imported.  You see  confirmations in your blockchain wallet and think all is well. One day later the coins have disappeared. Your payer merely sent the keys to the address you imported. He then moved the coins using the private key.  IMO this is an improbable attack but still possible. If you generated the paper wallet yourself and stored it safely its even less likely.,2014-03-02T06:57:07.000Z,0.25
2176,1.0,0,Heres an ELI  Those are Bitcoins version of dollar bills.  In Bitcoin every time you receive Bitcoin you receive a dollar bill in that exact amount you received.  When you spend bitcoins you can only use the dollar bills that youve received and if the amount you want to send is not able to be created EXACTLY with your bills you must use an excess of bills and send the remainder back to yourself as change for the transaction. However as wallet software can make unlimited addresses most transactions just look like theyre sending to two people when theyre actually sending to one person and sending the change back to themselves at a different address  dollar bills and change is a familiar way to think of bitcoin transactions and how they are denominated.,2014-07-04T17:56:52.000Z,0.25
2177,1.0,0,gtIts a market worth billions  Its not. You cant value Bitcoin as simply as that..   Adding up all the sell orders on the exchanges is a much more accurate way of gauging Bitcoins value than just multiplying the highest buy order by  million.   Both are flawed mind.    gtI think many in the bitcoin community are too optimistic. At the same time that likely sounds rather naive to the people who bought under a dollar and are parting with coins anytime since this past November. In the end I think things will work out to function much better than they do now but it may take a long time before that becomes a reality.  Nice to see someone a little more level headed. I agree although I actually dont see why Bitcoin will be the winner at all.. It doesnt really technologically have anything over other cryptocurrencies.   Its extremely recreatable.,2014-03-27T15:27:16.000Z,0.25
2178,1.0,0,I remember wanting to trade Bitcoin but I didnt want to risk sending money in the mail or wire to Mt. Gox.  Coinbase was were I first bought my Bitcoin. Bought about  BTC for about  right after the FBI took down Silk Road. Bought another  BTC a few weeks later as the fiscal cliff was coming up. I fell for the bear trap that we had and since Coinbase took forever to ACH out I couldnt buy back in quickly. Those were the days...  Anyhow I have been trading for the past few months. Have only had one bad sell and that was due to problems with selling on Localbitcoins when we were in a clear downward trend. Had to take a small loss.,2014-01-17T21:48:43.000Z,0.25

2184,1.0,0,There are other POS systems and attempts at increasing energy efficiency in the forms of merged mining to benefit from the existing bitcoinminers peercoin NXT and TaPOS of Invictusbitshares those are already working or further along than Ethereum. Problem with energyefficient and POS is that mining becomes irrelevant and with premine being seen as a scam that makes all nonmining solutions a hard sell right from the get go.  This also does not mean that there are no preminescams. Take Ethereum for example the more I hear and read about Ethereum the more it sounds like a scam or at the very least another attempt at a monopoly. The latest rumor being the need of special hardware licenses in order to run Ethereumnodes hardware licenses seem to be a preferred moneymining tool for the Ethereumsalesman Charles H. in his previous venture as was his idea of wanting to profit disproportionately from the efforts of the community if that rumor turns out to be true you can say bye bye to honest and free distribution and hello new monopolistic patenttroll.  Is there anyone who could explain why the hype around Ethereum is so large? As I understand it the whole idea is analogous to a pay per move EtchaSketch yeah you could conceivable draw anything but dont expect to be dazzled by the results. I dont see any chance of it replacing any of the serious drawing tools for making proper works of art like Bitcoin or the more serious altcoins.  Im having a hard time imagining any serious distributed project that needs a blockchain solution using something as limited as a single costly scripting language bottlenecked by a single monstrous blockchain for all projects simultaneously. Especially since the alternative means you have the option to use a purpose built efficient blockchain and at the same time the choice of using as many programming languages as you could possible want or need and everyone of them as Turing complete as the other.,2014-03-22T12:19:52.000Z,0.25

2187,1.0,0,I think that the development team has been awesome in creating all of the different wallets and different tools available for Digibytes but the core part of coin longevity is community support. Im hoping that if I can spread the word about this coin that it CAN be the next big thing. Im just sort of hooked on it. Fast transactions are a big part of that to me since other coins seem to take forever to transfer sometimes making them less viable for commercial use. Digibytes also has a better parody to the US dollar than bitcoin in my opinion. The idea of each Digibyte being worth only  seems much better than each coin being worth thousands of dollars. Mostly what caught my eye with Digibyte was its professionalism. When the coin came out it had an official announcement three days before and already had a professionally designed website and wallets on every platform. To me that gives a lot of credibility to it when a lot of new coins have websites on wordpress or require you to compile your own wallet when they are first released. I do agree with your fear of the coin just being a get rich quick kind of scheme but I think this coin could become a lot more if people give it a chance and grow the community.,2014-01-30T01:15:45.000Z,0.25

Its time to connect cryptos to the   Two further to this Dogecoins strength is its community. Please take no offence. It is a standard coin. Thats why Fidor accepted Ripple  not Doge. So same problem if you plod along behind Bitcoin you will have poor results Dogecoin is  to The Rest of The World  pretty much Bitcoin Small Model.

Then people forget new people come in and the cycle repeats.    On Friday I took a short position in TSLA by selling  x naked  May calls I like the company I made great money on the long side with them and I drive a model S.

I very likely wont keep this position till expiry mostly likely on the next down day for the Nasdaq TSLA will get hit very hard and then might be the time to take it off but we will see.

2303,2.0,0,Just for learning great.  But be careful creating your own bitcoin addresses if you plan to use them.  What you are doing is trying to create truly random large numbers.  You would not want to simply use the python random module as this provides pseudo randomness that is not appropriate for cryptography.  My understanding is that using os.urandom which uses the Operating System random number generator would be safer.  Even then nothing beats creating your large numbers with dice rolls.   As for the wallet not sure but sounds like a good way to learn anyway if you have an interest in bitcoin.  Always easier learning to code when you can match it up with something you enjoy.  cheers,2014-09-20T21:20:13.000Z,0.25

2310,2.0,0,Thats messed up. Thats why using Bitcoin is much cheaper and advantage. I think because you are purchasing something outside the US. Thats why its complicated for the Dutch seller here.

Its hard and difficult to encourage sellers to switch to Bitcoin thru Merchant services like BitPay Coinbase or Bitonic.nl has his own merchant service.

2311,2.0,0,The fact that people lost such large sums although sad is a feature of bitcoin and the ideals of a free market.   In our current monetary system both customers and creditors are saved by a central bank that bails out incompetent entities. The issue with this is  prudent savers are punished by having their money be devalued and  the market no longer has an incentive to identify and stop incompetent entities before they blow up. In fact it does the opposite and encourages bad behavior across the board.  But in bitcoin there is no bailout entity. Because of this customers and creditors have to be very careful about counter party risk. The end effect is individuals through the free market police themselves and take measures to ensure funds are lot lost in this manner or at least to minimize their loses.   Although sad the longterm effect of people losing money like this with MtGox will be to make the bitcoin ecosystem stronger through the free market taking corrective action instead of regulators. It is a longterm good thing that people are rewaking up to counter party risk and the need to protect themselves.,2014-03-05T21:15:24.000Z,0.25

If I use BitStamp directly is only . commission so p on  if Ive understood it correctly.

2327,2.0,0,blockchain.info seems to have gone downhill since they got massively funded. I dont know why the money hasnt made it much better but it was at one time a great part of bitcoin that now seems to be under attack. Maybe the money has been a distraction or delayed improvements.   IMO They have earned enough respect to be allowed to get their house in shape and succeed once again and I hope they can do that before the walls come crumbling down. The market has changed and what was acceptable  years ago is no longer enough. I think there has been a bit of a witch hunt but its been somewhat justified as well. Weakness will be forced out by ruthless competition.  And if they arent building HD and MultiSig then they will be left behind. That much is obvious.,2014-12-16T00:19:21.000Z,0.25

2330,2.0,0,No this is not how finance works. For example if you build a  billion dollar factory and in the first year you produce  cars for k each the cost of each car is not . million dollars its k. If it was . million dollars it would be an unprofitable car.  In other words if someone calls you up and says he wants to buy a car you quote him a production cost of k. You dont tell him the car costs over  million to produce because thats not the cost of producing that one car.  Similarly if a business asks the bitcoin foundation for advice amp information and asks what is the cost of  transaction you dont quote him  you quote him  cents. Because thats the cost of a transaction.  Yes I understand what youre saying but this is simply not how finance works. We dont mix fixed and variable and marginal costs all in one. Yes its an interesting metric thats not what Im trying to deny here. Im saying that the terminology for this metric is not a per transaction cost because thats not the correct semantics. And semantics really matters a lot. We saw the Swiss Bank UBS say bitcoin has  transaction fees comparable to creditcards because it didnt understand the difference.  For example the US dollar has . average inflation rates in the past  years. That doesnt mean that we start including them as transaction costs. Its just not the right terminology.  Yes important metric but its not a per transaction cost because its a cost regardless if theres  or  billion transactions. Its simply the cost of inflation and its set to drop below . in less than one generation.,2014-04-05T13:54:02.000Z,0.25

2340,2.0,0,That looks great but to me theres a simple and very basic problem. Darkcoin InstantX uses masternodes. These are a subset of nodes different from common nodes. This is clearly a step away from the truer decentralization achieved in Bitcoin.    My understanding is once you move away from decentralization there are many possible ways to implement instant transactions. But at the same time you lose the advantages of a more decentralized system. To me Bitcoin functions as a layer that is close to optimally decentralized. If services that require some level of centralization are needed they can and should be built on top of that.    Im not sure if InstantX is something that is tied into Darkcoin protocols at a low level but if it is it would take a lot to convince me that is an acceptable compromise.    On the other hand if InstantX is something that rides on top of Darkcoin I dont see why it cant be added on top of any other cryptocurrency that evolved from Bitcoin including of course the original.,2014-11-10T13:16:06.000Z,0.25

2347,2.0,0,Its not it looks like a permanent move. Changetip for example clearly and explicitly states their  fee is a promotion until date X which they pushed forward to next year they didnt remove if. Bitpay didnt do that they fully removed the fee.  They can do it because customers pay transaction fees. Its  free to receive money. And we already have  fee exchanges. Its a trivial cost for them to process payments which is why they see themselves as a SaaS company which generally follows a free model with enterprise options.   e.g. Skype is free because its very cheap for them to do data transfer when you yourself pay for the internet network you use and the computer hardware you use like you pay for bitcoin transactions you send pay for the internet network you use and the phone you send it from. Their cost is just a few servers running software. But while Skype makes a few hundred million in revenue off of customers Lync Microsofts enterprise solution to Skype makes about  billion. Its no different from Gmail or Dropbox which are free SaaS companies with advertising or enterprise monetization models.  In short Bitpays  is not temporary.,2014-12-13T14:43:17.000Z,0.25

2352,2.0,0,You can actually calculate the costs probabilistically speaking of mining.  It ends up that with a regular PC it costs MUCH more in electricity than you get back in Bitcoins.  In  or  programmers figured out a way to use the math processor on video cards to be more cost efficient and they basically made PCs obsolete for mining.   In  specialized computers called ASICs chips designed solely for Bitcoin mining came out and made graphics PCs obsolete.  Now faster chips are out and people who bought specialized machines in  are obsolete.  So yeah if you want Bitcoins buy them... its cheaper than buying them by paying your electric bill.,2014-08-12T18:43:38.000Z,0.25

2355,2.0,0,While this is cool I doubt it will be the reason Bitcoin is going to undoubtedly succeed. First of all the vast majority of people in this world dont need to wire large sums of money across international borders.   Second you implicitly converted the amount and transaction fee from Bitcoin to USD while in the real world this would cost you around  or around  to do. If all your financial dealings are in Bitcoin you are right but most people still need to pay their rent utilities etc. in fiat.  Third and I think this is most important if Bitcoins low transaction fees would ever become a real threat to the banking sector banks would simply lower their fees to match and find other ways to make money off of you.   People like to compare Bitcoin to the internet but to me its more like Linux. There exists an established solution i.e. fiatWindows that everybody uses and although it has warts is generally happy with. However if you care about certain ethical principles and want a communitydriven alternative BitcoinLinux gives you that option.  Of course there are always going to be people who think Bitcoin will dominate the world economy just as the Linux enthusiasts in the early ks thought Linux would conquer the desktop. It should be clear that didnt happen and its easy to see why. For the average user Linux didnt offer anything Windows didnt already have so why switch?  Having lived through the Linux desktop years when every bright teenager and twentysomething was developing instant messaging clients and audio players for Linux I see a huge amount of similarity with the Bitcoin community. When Dell was going to ship Linux laptops it was going to be huge for Linux!. Every piece of news was good news and every piece of good news was a game changer.   Imho Bitcoin will never be huge Linux will never conquer the desktop and Im perfectly fine with that. Just because only  of the world uses it doesnt mean Linux has failed. I run it every day and Im incredibly happy with it. The same should go for Bitcoin.  inb Android servers,2014-06-03T05:58:18.000Z,0.25

2360,2.0,0,Bitcoin does not force chargebacks disputes escrow counter party risk or anything that may fall under the false title of consumer protection.  This however does not mean you cant opt to use such a service.  Trusted third party escrow services multisig transactions and smart contracts are all possible with Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is programmable money you are free to use it anyway you like.  Sadly you chose not to use any consumer protection and made an irreversible transaction with a random stranger on the internet.  Bitcoin is still an early beta experiment not yet geared towards the non tech savvy.  Its getting more user friendly every day but will never be fully without risk.  Neither your loss or doubts in Bitcoin are the fault of the protocol or its ability to be good for the real world Your complaint could be compared to placing cash in an envelop and mailing it then getting mad at the post office when the recipient doesnt deliver.   While Im not trying to nor do I advocate punishing the victim But I do believe people need to take responsibility for their own actions.

Its normal for their practices in other exchsnges.  The exciting thing is if they are doing it then they are trying to take positions in bitcoin as we suspected they would this year.  So this is a good sign.  The othrr sign this is probably true are the simple baseless denial armies that emerge to say anyone is crazy who thinks so.

As with most libertarian ideas this one ends up in one currency to rule them all. At that point whats the difference in bitcoin or the dollar its still THE currency. Boy this shit just gets crazier and crazier. Part of the expense of alternative currencies is the rake off the top the people managing the currency get. Talk about getting ripped off. If I go out and buy bitcoin it will be priced in dollars and will be a market transaction. How does this make it different than buying dollars? At least when I use dollars the usage fee is in the form of taxes which I will see some benefit from. Bitcoins handlers just get rich from the usage fees. No I see nothing in alternative currencies but feudalism at the end. The same place all libertarianism ends up government of the weak by the strong.

2412,2.0,0,Its only contradictory because you dont understand what I meant. I meant there is little to no additional gain for a business like Microsoft to enter into trading nontraditional currencies. Success being converting that Bitcoin into a desirable form not some nebulous goal like the overall success of Bitcoin.   The risk comes from the fact that Bitcoin is extremely fickle and can easily lose half its value overnight.   So my point is Why would any smart company agree to take  that holds no value outside of a relatively small community? Well that money can be used in place of USD and whatever else you want! Well that requires going through a middleman or trying to exchange the value yourself during which time you lose money on fees or the value could have fluctuated into an undesirable amount. Assuming all goes well you get . The same amount you would have if the customer had just given you . Except you had to do additional work and take on additional risk therefore no major benefits guaranteed even with a successful transaction.   One final point to make would be that I point out Bitcoin can easily plummet in value constantly. Many supports of the currency will then point out that it can also boom in value very quickly and easily. I will say to you that is not a good thing and anyone who thinks it is has no place advising finances in any way. At least long term anyways. Not bad to make  over a day or week with minimal effort but thinking thats going to be a constant thing that will change your life is a joke,2014-12-22T23:01:38.000Z,0.25

2420,2.0,0,Thanks man...    Im a fan of Bitcoin But when I became an investor and trader I had to put away my admiration and become objective so I have make good rational decisions.  Ive been a big bear for the last  months...  And for  months weve been in a Bear market.   Its not that I predicted a bear market...   Its just that we were in a bear market so I acted like a bear.         But everyone is STILL bullish....        I think we will get out of this bear market sometime but Im not going to be bullish till we do.   And just knowing something as simple as being a bear in a bear market has allowed me to make money while everyone else is losing money.  I try to tell people...  few have listened for months...   Now we may be close toMAYBE going full Bull in the next few months and im very careful with my trades.     But be sure when we start going back up everyones going to be like See that Fixpunk were going up were making money youre an idiot  and im going to say...

2423,2.0,0,That is an interesting argument thanks for clarifying. On the one hand I want to argue that a commodity has value separate from its use as a mediumofexchange. But publishing on the blockchain is the same as making an exchange with bitcoin miners therefore it is not commodity money.  On the other hand your argument makes sense since bitcoin does have a commoditylike quality similar to the way electricity or computational cycles are useful.

2433,2.0,0,In case you are not aware GAW has been investing a lot of their efforts into their new cryptocurrency called Paycoin formerly called Hashcoin. While anyone is to welcome make their own judgment I personally believe it is a scam. The gist of the coin is that people were allowed to save up their profits from cloud mining as hashpoints rather than cashing out Bitcoin. Miners could then use  worth of otherwise useless hashpoints to purchase this new Paycoin. But why would a miner want to do that? Well because GAW is guaranteeing a  profit margin on day . They claim that they have banking partners and investors that will put up  million to make sure the price stays above  and that they expect it to go even higher than that. The coin is supposedly live now and on coinmarketcap but I wouldnt count it as truly live until miners are actually given the coins they are promised. But of course no legitimate institution has stepped forward to lend their credibility to the project. The only name theyve given out is Stuart Fraser of Cantor Fitzgerald LPa financial services firm but there is no public confirmation of this aside from GAWs own press releases. Im guessing this might turn out like MintPal where by the time you have absolute certainty of the scam its already too late. Better to get your money out before that point. I know many in the BlackCoin community had been buying GAW cloud miners so figured this is worth talking about here. GAW is also notorious for censoring their own forums so dont be surprised to come across shills and other such tactics at bitcointalk and other places and the usual pumpdump crowd of course.

2440,2.0,0,gt Even if we cant stop stolen coins moving  With  of the miners you can. The miners can agree not to include transactions with those coins as input and not to build ontop of any blocks which include those transaction.  But this is certainly not something I would ever want to encourage. The price of implementing censorship is much higher than the possible rewards. This shouldnt be possible at all and only is possible now because the system fails to keep mining decentralized. In my opinion miners starting to censor the blockchain is one of the biggest threads to bitcoin and dogecoin because it destroys the property of them being trustless systems. It would make dogecoin no better than paypal where people decide to freeze funds for seemingly arbitrary reasons.

Sure we already have Bitcoin so why do we need another cryptocurrency? Why not ask Linus Torvalds why he released Linux  years after Bell Labs gave us UNIX? Nobody thought anything of Linux when it first came out hardcore hackers and techtinkerers aside the big boys still all used UNIX.. now  years later its Linux embedded in your coffee maker its in your car your blueray player and on the International Space Station. Yeah it provides still many of the core features that UNIX did  years ago but Linux now has the distribution and progressive evolution. Its a different age a different market competition is good its what drives inovation in this space. I understand if you dont want to be an early adopter and thats your right but by the same argument you just stated what was once said about Bitcoin. Look into Vertcoin read up on why find as much information as you can and then make a decision on your own. Merchants are picking up Vertcoin at a higher rate than Bitcoin did in its early years only time will tell what will happen but this team is working hard to make a digital currency thats closer to Satoshis original intent and unfortunately for Bitcoin it may already be beyond that point of turning back and things are starting to centralize just like the antiquated power driven institutions Bitcoin was designed to replace.,2014-04-08T14:34:17.000Z,0.25

In a sense a de facto printer of the currency can come about through certain means.

2463,3.0,0,Considering you are saving quite a bit Id definitely contribute the max to your personal Roth IRA  last year so Im assuming the same this year.  Id also look into if your employer offers a Roth k instead of the standard k.  The limit for a Roth k is  in addition to the  for the personal roth account so you can get a lot of money into a taxsheltered roth account each year.  Either way definitely keep maxing out the employer matching cause thats free money.  As for your other specific questions   The mutual funds with Chase are both frontloaded and have relatively high expense ratios.  Id suggest investing with a noload fund group like Vanguard my personal favorite Fidelity or T Rowe Price.  Within that Id suggest finding low expenseratio index funds like the total stock market fund VTSMX the sampp  index fund VFINX and if you want international diversification the total international stock index fund VGTSX.  If you have over  in any of those funds make sure to get the admiral shares as theyre even lower expense ratios.     Reallocation of funds in your k depends on what funds you have access to and the expense ratios of the funds.  As I mentioned before lowcost noload broad index funds are generally a good place to start.   Risk is typically determined by the allocation of stocks vs bonds.  You have no bonds that I see so the risk is already quite high.  Additionally because a lot of the money is invested in specific companies individual stocks or bitcoin those are already highrisk.  Another thing to consider is bonds and bond funds.  These lower the risk of the portfolio but also lower the potential returns.  Most of the information and suggestions I just listed are basic boglehead investing strategies.  As the sidebar suggests rBogleheads is a good place for more resources on this.  The basic idea is longterm low cost index fund investing.  There are other strategies so Id investigate what exactly youre looking for in terms of goals but for longterm returns I havent found anything better than the boglehead approach.,2014-06-25T09:05:39.000Z,0.25

2468,3.0,0,gt Well if the original Silk Road handled . billion in a little over a year of transactions   First it operated for  months.  Second the prosecutor inflated the value of Silk Road sales.  He stated  These figures are equivalent to roughly . billion in revenue and . million in commissions at current Bitcoin exchange rates... according to the September  complaint  Note the at current exchange rates.  The Silk Road operated from Feb  to Jun .  The price of one coin was anywhere from about  to  in this period except for the last  months when it averaged about .  At the time of the indictment it was around .  So the true sales volume was vastly inflated by using the much higher price.  Another way to calculate the impact of the Silk Road is to divide the . million coins claimed to be transacted by  months of operation giving  coinsday.  Total bitcoin transaction volume over the same period averaged about  million coins per day.  Thus the Silk Road represented .  The prosecutor doesnt explain where the . million number comes from whether pure sales transaction inputs including change or double counting escrow movements and mixer operations.

2486,3.0,0,well according to some nutcases the fed just has to fire up the printers to create money and thats what its doing. I also dont think understanding the protocol is necessary to understanding bitcoin just like understanding the difference between the monetary base M M and M money supply is necessary to using fiat.  Given the fact that crypto only works with M it is a lot easier to grasp than fiat. I agree  though that money creation by the fed is harder to understand than mining bitcoin but does that really matter? Im a dogecoin regular and I started a column about monetary economics over there to give people a better idea of where cryptocurrencies fit into the equation. People are getting more interested but they often lack the fundamentals to understand how money and financial systems even work.  either way I find it disheartening to see the OP somehow associating something being mainstream with it being bad and wrong and idiotic isnt mainstream acceptance something bitcoin wants?,2014-02-14T10:23:43.000Z,0.25

2499,3.0,0,To be honest the bitcoin network isnt the blockage. The blockage is all the exchanges and payment processors which work on top of bitcoin.

Just look at the number of posts on rbitcoin about not being able to contact coinbase support or bitstamp support lets not mention MtGox support. The rate of growth at the moment is too fast for the services to catch up with demand. To be fair many of these services are slowly getting there after the slowdown in new users following the price stagnation this year.,2014-02-20T17:25:23.000Z,0.25

2505,3.0,0,Ive made arguments like this before but they never seem to go over as well as Id like.  I think the problem is that if bitcoin fails either because of a competing cryptocurrency or because were all wrong about its utility it kind of does look like a ponzi scheme. Early adopters make money because they got in so cheap and sold while it was high late adopters lose everything.  Unlike a ponzi scheme though if bitcoin succeeds everyone wins theres no eventual inevitable implosion.

2511,3.0,0,gt Im not sure I would classify Bitcoin as a deregulated financial service. Its the technological baseline of a system on top of which regulated financial services could be built. In that sense I would compare it more to like the internet where Bitcoin is equivalent to TCPIP. I know this is kind of a cliche at this point.  Very cliched. I was referring more to the concept of a financial system outside of the control of governments which would almost certainly be unregulated and therefore pretty much terrible for most participants working in it. Bitcoin itself could have regulated financial services built on top of it yes but we then come to a question  what point is there in doing so? What functions Bitcoin does not share with all other payment methods are niche enough to be useless or significantly flawed and what it does the same as all other payment methods it mostly does worse and less efficiently. What features it has as a currency are economically braindead. What would the point in taking the current financial system and essentially rebuilding it on top of Bitcoin?  gt The concepts of central banking and fiat money may be good ones that work well. But in my mind they are not set in stone like the laws of physics. They are man made ideas and its possible there are better ideas that could come along. The internet is a tremendous tool that has not been around for long it seems likely it will continue to spawn tremendous ideas in their own right.  They are man made ideas and they are not set in stone but currently they are the best that we have. If a better idea comes along then no doubt itll be great if we adopt it but Bitcoin is categorically not that idea. Bitcoin takes the shitty economic ideas of around  years ago and combines them with needless complexity pointlessly inefficient decentralisation and a baseline requirement for a working always on telecommunications infrastructure that may not always be there.  gt Fixed money supply may be a bad idea. I have not researched it enough to fully understand what the issues would be with it. Regardless a programmable financial system means there could be inflation built in as there are with other alt coins. Maybe that is a bad idea too though.  The thing is a fixed money supply and a money supply that is set to always inflate or deflate at regular intervals are both bad for the same reason this being the reason the gold standard failed and your separation of trading pieces of gold and pieces of paper supposedly backed by them is rather academic except for the point that trading bits of gold does not allow for fractional reserve banking and fractional reserve also a good thing. Fixed money supplies and programatically increasingdecreasing supplies do not expand and contract with economic growth or depression potentially leading to out of control inflation or deflation and worse  compared to an adjustable money supply  completely remove a means of avoiding or shortening recessions from governments.

But yeah the . trillion dollars increase in the U.S. U.K and Japan are currently as you say being stored on bank ledgers right now. The only upside to QE is that you can try to fight of recessions with it but I see many more downsides.  I dont know if I agree about another bubble until there is more instability. We dont know what country could be the next to buy into Bitcoin like hotcakes which could lead to one sooner rather than much later. But it does make sense that for now the only real guarantee that will happen at some point is global economy instability.

The sub has a flair system so that you can tell the difference between an honest seller and a scammer. But you must be aware a verified seller isnt going to risk his doge to you either some sellers will accept paypal if you have a verified account bank transfer and if you live in US Google wallet. Just spending  minutes reading links on the side bar and becoming familiar with the prices people are selling for you should be able to buy all the doge you want.

2524,3.0,0,I agree.   I also think its worth mentioning that for it to act as a currency it must be able to hold worth.   One of the negative points skeptics often pick up on with Bitcoin is that on its own it has little value other than as a facility to transfer worth true or not its a view that certainly does exist.  Theyd argue that goldplatinum etc has many industrial applications and therefore a greater foundation for its base worth.   By definition ether as a fuel within a decentralised IT platform with many brand new potentially game changing technological applications. Suddenly it seems a lot more like goldplatinum as store of value in that it has other uses besides just transferring value adding to its base worth.  Coupled with the fact that it can be used as a currency so easily you could argue that in respect to what was discussed above it is better than Bitcoin at being a currency.  Having written this it makes me think that any future currencies based on ethereum could well have an ether standard where by all of the currencys funds are backed by a vault of ether.  Tldr Ether has more applications than Bitcoin on its own and in my opinion becomes more similar to gold or platinum as a store of value. Together with its ease of transference it potentially exceeds Bitcoin as a currency.   Please correct me if Im wrong on this Im still learning!,2014-07-27T12:13:35.000Z,0.25

2527,4.0,0,Bitcoin is a young protocol. That means you can create services around it. You dont think theres EVER going to be a secure method to keep and use bitcoins?   Also I think a lot of the power behind Bitcoin is derived from the fact that instead of the banker learning how to process transactions its the customer. Its opensource so you know how it works.  I guarantee that if you have decent researching skills even now you can learn to set up paper wallets for the majority of your money and online wallets for daytoday transactions.

2532,4.0,0,Im afraid that youre right.  People who say that validation will harm Bitcoin by reducing its fungibility are absolutely correct.  Coin validation sounds simple and reasonable on the surface but once you get into crossjurisdictional issues its likely to become a complete nightmare.  Imagine a local judge in Brazil rules that some of your coins are actually stolen and the court reports this to a coin validation service.  Is that judgement enforceable in a U.S. court?  Who knows and do you want to have to go to court to litigate it?  Unfortunately as the saying goes hard cases make bad law and Im afraid that the first time a Bernie Madoff steals some poor widows Bitcoins or even worse a kidnapping ransom is paid in Bitcoins the political pressure to require coin validation will be very hard to resist regardless of some obscure common law precedent from th Century Scotland says.  This is going to be a big big problem much harder to solve than any technical issues.  Its something that we need to start talking about how to deal with rather than just downvoting people who bring up the issue and pretending that we can make the issue go away by ignoring it.,2014-01-01T21:48:11.000Z,0.0
2533,4.0,0,Every  minutes an unalterable block is added into the chain of existing blocks by computers running software miners  thus blockchain.    This blockchain is stored permanently on all minersnetwork nodes computers and cannot be unwritten.  Everyone agrees on this past history with no requirement to trust each other thats the whole breakthrough that everyone is excited about.  Each block in the blockchain is filled with valid information according to the rules of the network.  In Bitcoin this is transactions from A gt B but could be any other form of information.  For instance Bitmessage uses the same concept to create a decentralised email service.  For the first time in history a potentially infinite group of people can now agree on something without ever having met and without trusting each other at all.  Everyone must follow the rules established by the network and supported by a majority of users and no one has an ability to coerce the network into something most users dont agree with.  Being geographically distributed its also very hard to take down the network.  This has created Bitcoin the worlds first global currency.  The limits of what else can be achieved are at the moment beyond anyones imagination but some small uses are starting to show up eg. decentralised secure messaging Bitmessage or perhaps a replacement for TCPIP.  httpwww.reddit.comrBitcoincommentskkwlbitpay_project_aims_to_do_for_networks_what,2014-10-28T14:27:24.000Z,0.25

Just finished becoming a member of the Digital Currency Institute down here in San Diego. I am attending the meetups here in San Diego and Orange county on Bitcoin. Steve asked me to speak on a global webinar for the institute in April and the Rotary club has asked me to speak for them as well in April. Thanks so much for your guidance. I soak up everything you say and its starting to come out of my mouth so we are getting there.   Ill contact the local news and journalists next week.   Be well Marn,2014-02-15T16:12:17.000Z,0.25

2541,4.0,0,Paraphrased from Wikipedia A Ponzi scheme involves an operator who pays returns to investors with new capital from new investors.  Simply put  Bitcoin has no operator.  The claim that it is a Ponzi scheme is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of Bitcoin or Ponzi schemes or both.  Furthermore the current value of Bitcoin is largely based on speculation about its UTILITY as a financial instrument.  Whereas a Ponzi scheme is nothing more than a shell game the price fluctuations of Bitcoin occur as the market collectively processes huge amounts of information to seek the true value of this new technology.  IMO people who call Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme clearly dont understand Bitcoin and are simply slandering it by associating it with a financial scam  which they probably dont understand either.,2014-04-14T13:05:36.000Z,0.25

2551,4.0,0,Systems like Nxt and Peercoin will have excessive fees if they intend to allow everyone to be a validator and earn fees at scale. What this means for Nxt and Peercoin is that anyone with less than  stake cannot validate profitably unless their fees are higher than our DPOS chain. If these chains assume  delegates is too centralized and start promoting they have  validators then their fees must be x those of DPOS. If such a chain grew to be the size of Bitcoin  B then only those with M worth of coin could validate profitably and most would consider that an elite club. If they reduce the minimum stake to be a validator to  then their fees would be  times higher than DPOS.  Developers of DPOS assume that everyone with less than the amount required to validate wont participate. Also assumed is a reasonable distribution of wealth. Its clear that unless alternate chains have unusually high fees there will only be a handful of people with enough stake to validate profitably.  httpwiki.bitshares.orgindex.phpDPOSScalability,2014-09-12T19:55:56.000Z,0.25

2561,5.0,0,When you want to send Bitcoins to someone via a stealth address you generate a shared key or a nonce your private stealth key  their public stealth key and a Bitcoin public key to send the funds to.    This nonce can be published on a forum website or to the blockchain in the Bitcoin transaction via OP_RETURN OP_PUSH. The receiver then scans transactions for the nonce and attempts to generate the Bitcoin private key cryptomagic using the nonce  your stealth private key. If it is successful then the transaction obviously belongs to you and you can importsweep the Bitcoin private key into your wallet.  AFAIK SPVbased clients like Electrum do something like this anyway so scanning each nonce wouldnt be that onerous. Plus there is a way to create a watch address so you know that you have received funds though I dont fully understand this part yet.

2570,5.0,0,gt This immediately sets up a head to head competition between the original and its clone based on the merits of the tech alone.  No the competition is not based on the merits of the tech alone or even predominantly. Adoption who will accept it what tools are available how much do you trust it to survive what is the exchange rate is something that is often largely technology unrelated. Adoption is driven by network effect and tends to overwhelmingly dominate the motivation to accept one thing vs another in the space of a money like good.  After all a currency gains its value not by anything intrinsic but by how it enables us to interact with each other.  In the competative example people who have no interest in using a currency can be forced by market forces into it.  I like Foocoin it fits my politics and needs well.  You are indifferent.  Alice likes Barcoin strongly and hates foo coin.  Your business with Alice is critical to your livelihood so you are using Barcoin with her. I show up and you start insisting I use Barcoin too.  I can deprive myself of the benefit of our interactions I can expend resources trying to talk you into a different position or I can invoke some costly middleman and some unstable illiquid market to convert the coins and deal with the barcoin stuff that I dont like.  Having to make that choice between three notgreat options is a reduction in my freedom relative to a world where I was really king of my own destiny. Its not exactly a boot stomping my face for all eternity but the pressure of the people around me that I interact with constrains my freedom.  A world where we dont have to have competition between currencies in order to have advancement and innovation in transaction processing and payments is I think one that enables more freedom and autonomy for people.  gt Sidechains run a severe risk of disrupting Bitcoin.  A severe risk compared to further increasing the supply of coins and then incentive people to go around convincing people to abandon Bitcoin and use the other thing instead? Im pretty skeptical there.  From a technological perspective the sidechain stuff is very loosely coupled.  If substr and cat had not been disabled and if there were a way to read the txouts onto the stack people could already be creating sidechains and you couldnt easily stop them.    Contrary to what youre saying I think that invoking a clone system which fork the monetary base and then seeking to then compete with Bitcoin are by its very design and nature something specifically intended to disrupt and supplant Bitcoin. It invokes adverse competition where none is needed  Parallel transaction processing networks for Bitcoin can coexist and gain or lose transaction volume on their own merits without the need of a competing currency to replace the whole thing.,2014-04-10T10:51:48.000Z,0.25
2571,5.0,0,Ill just copy pasta a response I just wrote in another thread because I feel its pertinent  If youre trying to start a bitcoin business or comply with tax code and MSB requirements....then Im afraid the U.K. looks pretty friendly.  Theres a disproportionate concentration of bitcoiners full nodes and venture capital in the U.S. so it shouldnt be surprising that the Circles and Coinbase of the world still managed to start up in the u.s. first rather than elsewhere but there is also a reason why mt. Gox had little competition and no major u.s.based competition before it failed spectacularly with way too much of the market share it is far more costly and uncertain to start a business in the u.s.s political regulatory and tax environment than it is almost anywhere else on earth.  As a capital asset there is no way for the average user here to actually go about using bitcoin as an everyday money and possibly be in compliance with the reporting and tax requirements of the IRS.

2585,5.0,0,who here is seriously going to pay for virtual farmville items with their precious btc?yeah probably nobody... if btc keeps following the overall same predictable pattern we will see many more lows for the next  months or so though i think the  in dec was the lowest unless something really big moves the market probably not reaching  again until the next big rise if there is one.  after witnessing the last  bubbles personally and looking at the data for the earlier ones i think a fair market price for a while would be about half price of the last high so about bitstamp.   I think wherever bitcoin goes next in these upcoming  months will make or break it since we have so many eyes on it now and it is worth so much compared to where it was just  year ago. governments are actually figuring out what to do about it mining is way more difficult taxation guidelines are coming etc... even . years ago many of us thought the government wouldntshouldnt ever get involved or even take it serious to the point of more than scoffing at it... and now look where we are...   I was naively ideological about btc from the beginning wanting to spend them anywhere i could instead of dollars super excited about their potential to change the state of central banking and government taxation. Power to the people!! etc... but im sensing the world is not capable of embracing a decentralized currency which is sad. Quite honestly bitcoin as elegant as it is I could see doing a lot more damage than good since it would continue to suck legitimacy from all the fiatgovernment systems that pretty much everybody is heavily invested in. Most people are just too used to the conveniences short term? of centralized financial systems i think. maybe my understanding of things are still too shallow but this is the gist im getting lately with bitcoin... it was more viable as a pipedream before and now that things are coming to fruition i dont know if I personally really even like what it will become. All the reasons most people liked it in the first place will be stripped away by regulations and taxes and btc hoarding and the real people benefiting when its large scale are the big vendorscorporations and early btc adopters.  i dont know if itll be the world saving sabotager of central banks that i thought up in my head anymore.  obviously i dont think everybody in the community needs to agree with that sentiment but it is what initially got me riled up about bitcoin. I thought man what perfect timing for something like this to come out. and indeed it still is... exposing the system for what it is forcing people to talk about the financial system more and particular problems with it that btc may solve for example.,2014-01-17T15:13:02.000Z,0.25

2589,5.0,0,The website itself doesnt include tipping natively right now. Were about to release the next version of our frontend v but as we wanted to allow our users to tip themselves before that we decided to begin with a Chrome extension to enable it clientside.  We wanted to show how easy it is to make a microtransaction with cryptocurrencies and how great it could be for communitybased websites as we are. Enable tipping is a good way for that.  BTW we dont act as a wallet we dont store coins. Were a tech news website mainly journalists so our job is not to do that. We decided to use external tipbots  tipdoge amp tippercoin. Users have to install the extension to tip somebody else. Two little buttons are shown in news comments amp forum topics if they do one for bitcons one for dogecoins.   If you want to receive tips you just have to indicate a twitter adress in your account.   This is just first release of it it allows us to talk about it with our readers our community and decide what are next steps. I think its also a way to show to other websites what they could do with cryptocurrencies.   As we have two subscription plans no ads only  premium features some of our readers ask us to enable bitcoin paiements. Even if I think it could be a good move in the future I think that those who thinks that cryptocurrencies are just a replacement of dollars  euros misses the point.   Add a crypto public address is the easy part. Think about how crypto could change relationships not only between users and websites but between evry internet users from a global perspective is the right thing to do. We try to it will be a long path.   If you want to add same style buttons to your favorite website clientside with a Chrome extension or any other browser the code is open source available here    !,2014-03-25T19:43:16.000Z,0.25

2597,6.0,0,A shill? Do you not know the definition of a shill?  A shill is a person who avoids disclosing their connection with what theyre promoting. Obviously shes not a shill as shes on the board of the bitcoin foundation.  Shes out there to educate mainstream users about what bitcoin is. She focuses mostly on the fact that its a sociopolitical game changer not so much on it being a slightly better currency for some merchants. I dont see any reason why people bash her. Youd rather have just paul krugman in the media critisizing bitcoin and only core developers responding? Get real.  As for when she was elected is she supposed to run an ad in the new york times to inform you people? She was elected at an organisation which you can easily become a member of if you sign up you get informed about everything they do and you can vote on various issues and people.,2014-03-31T20:53:58.000Z,0.25

This bitcoin wallet can be married to another remote wallet in multisignature so that for each transaction you also have to authorize with two factor authentication.

2622,7.0,0,Supply is scheduled and known. Demand determines price.  Edit Since there are so many naysayers it may help to read the article linked in the top comment.  gt Money supply works as a standard supply so that its increase leads to price decrease. Negative relationship is thus expected. Moreover due to a known algorithm of bitcoins creation only longterm horizons are expected to play a role. In Fig.  we observe that there is some relationship between Bitcoin price and its supply. However most of the significant regions are outside of the reliable region. Moreover the orientation of the phase arrows is unstable so that it is not possible to detect either of a sign or a leader of the relationship. This might be due to the fact that both current and future money supply is known in advance so that its dynamics can be easily included in the expectations of Bitcoin users and investors.

It auctioned off bitcoin seized from the Silk Road drug ring. There were more than  bidders in the auction with a number of wellknown players in bitcoin saying they were unsuccessful.  gtDraper is an active investor who has invested in more than  private companies.

I think this move is to get some extra attention when other exchanges are are most likely faking their volumes and to get more Chinese people interested in crypto as investment with a cheaper altcoin.  Litecoin also got overshadowed by new altcoins so this is a natural move from a trading platform to get more trading and promote Litecoin which already have good trading volumes on other Chinese exchanges.

2654,10.0,0,It is a simple balance of cost to produce vs target profit. Assuming a  electricity cost then you just need the hardware that can mine currency as a hashrate high enough to produce the profit level youre looking for.  Aside from electricity the thing you need to consider is the increase in difficulty of whatever you are mining. The rate at which you profit from a mining strategy for a single currency is not constant it is constantly declining as more blocks are solved and the difficulty level goes up which means it takes you longer to complete blocks at the same hashrate. If you choose one currency lets just say Bitcoin you will constantly need to be getting more hardware to keep up with the increasing difficulty so you must factor that hardware cost into your daily targets.  For example assuming a  power cost at current difficulty level and exchange rate you would need to mine Bitcoin at minimum . THs in order to make  USDday never mind equipment costs. The difficulty will also go up steadily so you will need to keep adding hardware to keep up this profit rate  helps.,2014-02-14T22:18:05.000Z,0.25

Even though the dot coms bubbled and crashed they literally changed everything in the entire world. If its not going to be bitcoin please believe the world will create a decentralized peer to peer money exchange system. Why dont we deserve that? Why should we have to go through old remittance industries to send money across the globe? Made sense before this new technology for security but why must we continue to pay the middleman? Id rather pay a bitcoin middleman than the crooks who control the older alternatives. I think you need to sit down and read about the fundamentals of the bitcoin system and stop dwelling on the price speculation and circle jerkers. I hope the best for you. Most of the population has no idea what bitcoin is so you are ahead of the game. Stop trying to compare it to anything. Just accept it as something new in this world. No one is forcing you to buy it.,2014-01-18T21:46:12.000Z,0.25

2747,54.0,0,Im here to make money whether theres an uptrend or a downtrend. I dont believe in Bitcoins longterm success. Too many people place faith on the network effect and assume that because Bitcoins first its going to succeed. Bullshit. Its only a matter of time before a better altcoin comes along that solves the  problem quantum computing problem MB limit problem amongst many others. Sure all of the fixes to these things could be added to Bitcoin. MySpace also could have turned into Facebook. But it didnt.   What was that one quotation Bitcoiners love to cite against fiat? Something about sometimes its just easier to build something new than to fix whats already broken. Ah! That would also apply to Bitcoin vs altcoins.  And yes the infrastructure thats already built around Bitcoin does make Bitcoin stronger. But guess what? It also makes altcoins stronger. The barrier of entry and cost to adding altcoins into the existing infrastructure is only going to become increasingly easier. Think about it  if altcoins arent a threat there wouldnt be a need for Bitcoiners to constantly deride and insult the competition.,2014-01-21T01:07:30.000Z,0.25
2748,20.0,0,Bitcoin has first mover advantage and widespread acceptance the network effects from that are immense. As for technically inferior that depends how you look at it also. Because of the higher valuation much more attention has been focused on actually trying to break the core in some way that could be extremely profitable for anyone who could do it.   Take a more innovative but far more obscure coin like Heavycoin for example it was ostensibly made with the idea that it would be immune to GPU mining and they used quite a few stacking algorithms to get it to that state. It turned out to be mined by GPU within two weeks of launch. All of these other altcoins have far less attention paid to the algorithms securing their blockchains and it shows when you hear things like that as well as the author of the scrypt algorithm saying it was incorrectly employed in Litecoin and thus almost all of its descendants.  What Im getting at is that this valuation and massive attention has direct effects on the reliability of the blockchain itself.  Is heavycoindarkcoinvertcoin going to vanish in the next year? Who knows. Is Bitcoin? Extremely unlikely.   Not to mention that even by design the whole mining idea is based around a  attack being resource prohibitive to execute. The smaller the mining effort on a given blockchain the less true this is. Trying to attack Bitcoin  by this method would be by far the most expensive of all of the various cryptocurrencies.  Altcoins are not Bitcoin and trying to say Bitcoin can lose value because it can be exchanged for other coins is like trying to say that the dollar might lose value because it can be exchanged for the franc.,2014-03-29T14:33:36.000Z,0.25
2749,102.0,0,For anyone who didnt know the concept of Bitcoin Days Destroyed like me  gt The idea of bitcoin days destroyed came about because it was realised that total transaction volume per day might be an inappropriate measure of the level of economic activity in Bitcoin. After all someone could be sending the same money back and forth between their own addresses repeatedly. If you sent the same  btc back and forth  times it would look like  btc worth of activity while in fact it represents almost nothing in terms of real transaction volume.  gt With bitcoin days destroyed the idea is instead to give more weight to coins which havent been spent in a while. To do this you multiply the amount of each transaction by the number of days since those coins were last spent. So  bitcoin that hasnt been spent in  days  bitcoin   days counts as much as  bitcoins that were just spent yesterday  bitcoins   day. Because you can think of these bitcoin days as building up over time until a transaction actually occurs the actual measure is called bitcoin days destroyed. This is believed to give a better indication of how much real economic activity is occurring on the bitcoin network.

2750,29.0,0,I keep reading comments like this.  Im not sure if you understand that there is a good possibility that those cheap coins someone is buying dont actually exist in the blockchain.  It is very possible that Gox has none left and that the balances shown to customers dont actually exist.    Although Bitcoin isnt a Ponzi scheme any nontransparent exchange can become something similar to a Ponzi by running a fractional reserve.  Once no more funds are coming in those left holding balances on the exchange find out that the balance doesnt exist.  If this is the case for Gox then it may be better to hold a fiat balance than a BTC balance.,2014-02-20T11:59:35.000Z,0.25

2753,19.0,0,Its because of the donations the branding the new concepts that I chose to mine Dogecoin instead of Litecoin. Its because of these things that I tell everyone about Doge and how it differs from the stuffy communities of Litecoin and Bitcoin.  This is what separates Doge from the others.   There are far more Dogecoins than vendors right now. But every time the Major news organizations mention Doge because of one of our stunts  we gain MORE main stream appeal. Every vendor is still going to cash out to fiat the vast majority of the time. Technically NAscar IS a vendor. We just purchased a massive TV ad spot. That is NOT  donation. We bought something that puts us on PAR with major corporations. Every lap that this car does in the track at what ever race its going to puts us in front of HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of viewers. Its going to be weird to many. Its going to be talked about by many. This was a PURCHASE. Bitcoin hasnt gotten together and done brand awareness like this. Neither has Litecoin. This is a true grassroots marketing campaign. Completely crowd sourced. This can also let others know of a new way to collect advertisement  funds. Here is a new source of revenue that companies never though of. A massive group of people willing to spend funds to become known. WE MOVE MONEY. NOT JUST HOLD ONTO IT. It doesnt matter how its done. Donations advertisement vendors tips. Every time we do something new and innovative more NON digitalcoin users find out about us. Bitcoin miners strip mine us BECAUSE we are the goto coin for value. That wont change until we cant be mined anymore.  We need more main stream appeal this also brings in more vendors. I think what the community has done is the right thing.,2014-03-26T15:42:34.000Z,0.25
2754,121.0,0,Both changes require a fork.  Kimitos Gravity Well is somewhat likely in the future and that would be driven by market forces and hash rates. If our hash rate is not high enough after upcoming halvenings due to market prices not keeping up our hash rate and difficulty may start to swing wildly due to multipools jumping on and off. If implemented it will get rid of the multipool issue that many other scrypt coins have had to face and solved this way.  Most adaptive scryptn arguments are fear based. They also dont point to any of the downsides of doing this i.e. people having to change a whole bunch of existing infrastructure requiring custom mining software etc. ASICs that are currently in the wild are not better than graphics cards. ASICs for Bitcoin took a long time to get to the state they are currently at which is the reason for the fear.

Just sign up for an account at coinbase.com to get a bitcoin address and add it to your website somewhere along with a nice qr code.

I cant know for certain because most of the large holders who are publicly active are sketchy as fuck.   gtIf anything Id argue those individuals have an incentive of making bitcoin as functional and long lasting as possible.  Yes. Bitcoin. You are basically making my point for me here. There is nothing inherently superior about bitcoin. By clinging to this brand of cryptocoin for financial reasons you are depressing the exploration of alternatives. Thus you see the continuously rehashed arguments about how dumb copycoins are and how all of the terrible problems with bitcoin will be solved eventually by somebody.  gtThat doesnt mean a la la la Im not listening approach either. Many of the large holders got into bitcoin for ideological reasons and making improvements will only help bitcoins stickiness.

Every day since April  there have been numerous threads about MtGox warnings scam stories speculation about their solvency accusations of malpractice etc. People ignored all of that to get a  higher price for their coins compared to BTCE or Stamp.

2800,0.0,0,gt I am certain the mean return on one time investment in mining gear is the same for big and small pools even under exponential difficulty increase.   So?   The mean return for a  off game of  double or nothing game of chance is always going to be  too that doesnt mean its not gambling or that it isnt colossally stupid for a business to engage in.    This fact alone makes mean return a worthless measurement. Because the return for any one  miner will never be  the mean  Because of changing difficulty per period you cannot make up for any loss or gains incurred.    Simple illustration. If you got unlucky and get less bitcoin than you should for difficulty X and X  chance of this happening then by the time difficulty gets to X you will statistically almost never be able to recoup your losses no matter how long you proceed to mine afterwards. Any subsequent good luck will only return to you a fraction of your initial losses. Which means you need net positive good luck. Thats not happening.   In fact just by being unlucky once at difficulty level X would prob mean you can never regain lost ground.   The bigger the variance the bigger this loss would be. The fact that the potential gain is higher is irrelevant. Business dont want to gamble. If they do want a greater rate of volatility they can manually implement it through satoshi dice.     gtSorry it is. This calculation is under the assumption you are reinvesting the returns.  No. Its made under the assumption of continuous maintenance of equivalent mining power.   you dont seem to understand the basic math here. This is similar to but not entirely identical  to the stock example I used. Youre always making a positive return that positive returns magnitude however will change. You dont have to reinvest all the returns just sufficient to maintain your power as a  of the whole market. That reinvestment cost can be a fraction of expected returns.,2014-06-15T18:57:15.000Z,0.25

2808,0.0,0,RDD is a great cryptocurrency but theres a few things you should know before you throw caution to the wind. POSV is a great new system to reward people securing the network. The only problem is that transaction volume is going to be astronomical as well as the blockchain will be exploding. What does this mean? When people search for transaction volume on RDD it will be HUGE since transactions are constantly happening as apart of the POSV system. This will not be able to represent the current transaction volume Whales who are used to BitCoin and check for profitability against transaction volume may buy in and pump the coin above its real value. If you buy in understand that this is currently unstable because whales are populating it.

2816,0.0,0,A quick look at it would suggest that doge might get some of the  millions making up Litecoins market cap right now as both currencies are very similar and often cited alongside each other. News are either about Bitcoin only or about Bitcoin  Litecoin  Dogecoin .... The same goes for merchants. If they support Bitcoin and then go the extramile to support Litecoin chances are high that dogecoin will be there too.  Being pessimistic the worst scenario could be Bitcoin market cap halved around  billions USD DogecoinBTC halved around  satoshis   millions market cap  .   Doge.  Best scenario still being overly pessimistic Bitcoin market cap rise   billions DogecoinBTC doubled around  satoshis   millions market cap  .   Doge.  Theres no real highest value only the moon.  We are a big subreddit when it comes to crypto probably the most active and still we are tiny peckle if you consider the amount of people paying daily on the internet. And that amount rises very fast. Payment through mobile is something that will grow very fast. Right now in China theres a race between Tencent and Alibaba to provide bankingpayment services. They have very well done apps and higher interest rates than banks.   TLDR crypto cant die dogecoin can in the long run its moon for everyone.

2823,1.0,0,I appreciate the response but the purpose of the question was to really have uthrowawayo answer it or as he has been and as was expected do everything he could to run away.  In several exchanges uthrowawayo has delighted in being an imperious condescending jackass to people while also making it clear to anyone who understands the topic that he himself has a very limited grasp of Bitcoin.  So Ive been asking him to calculate some fairly simple probabilities central to the Bitcoin security model and as expected he has run away as fast as his big mouth can carry him.  Again I appreciate your response and your views but youve oversimplified the math and led yourself astray on the answers.  A successful doublespend isnt just a matter of hitting three in a row its a matter of being able to build a false chain faster than the legitimate chain.  The actual probabilities are    .    .     .    .  As you can see even after six confirmations the probability of a successful doublespend attack with  percent of the hashing are actually excellent.   Thats why the rule of thumb of the number of confirmations to be safe was arbitrarily set at six by Satoshi.  He assumed no one would ever have more than  percent of the hashing power and the probability of a successful doublespend with  percent and  confirmations is ..  Ill be happy to explain the details of the calculation once uthrowawayo has decided to reveal the expertise he has hidden from us so completely or decided to address his belief that bullying people is an effective substitute for knowing what youre talking about.,2014-01-13T01:47:07.000Z,0.25

Bitcoin is a concept thats infused with an aura of technological mysticism and that makes talking about it difficult  What if we introduced a new paper currency called the foo. The foo is exchangeable for native currencies somehow has no issuing authority and can be traded in relative privacy. The foo is introduced alongside existing currencies in existing states with the existing distribution of capital. Eventually the dollar yen euro etc are abandoned for the foo. After this process is complete what has changed? Besides making it bit more difficult for states to collect taxes what is better about the foo future?

Time efficiency is something extremely important when prepping dont waste time prepping the bill that isnt going to make the docket when you could be spending time prepping one that will most likely be quite high if your not sure if a bill will make the docket its your personal guage of what you think your peers will think of the bill normally you could ask your teamates their opinion however obviously for you this isnt an option if you want you can pm me and id be more then happy to give you my opinion on a bill or help you prep or anything.,2014-02-28T03:42:47.000Z,0.25

Its not necessarily bad Larry Page sold some monthly if I remember right but it could be interpreted as a bad sign from someone whos in the know.  Opinion this is appling legacy thinking to Bitcoin.  Satoshi has no control over Bitcoin and likely has less knowledge than others by this point.  He at least has no special information that isnt freely available.  Selling his coins should only depress a Bitcoins value because we know those  are spendable but should not change the value we have in it for better or worse.

2887,1.0,0,Because market cap does NOT reflect the total amount of money put into it. In fact theres no reliable metric for that.  Market cap is a rather stupid metric its the total number of coins multiplied by the latest trade price.  Lets say the bitcoin price is  for simplicity sake.  The bitcoin market cap would be          . billion dollars  If I now buy at the lowest available sell offer of  the market cap would jump up by . million dollars.  In fact I dont even have to buy a whole coin for that.  Tiny purchases can change the market cap significantly. If you want to have exact numbers look at the market depth of big exchanges and be amazed how little money you need to move the price and thus the market cap a lot.,2014-03-05T01:59:05.000Z,0.25

2893,1.0,0,The reason most Bitcoin afficianados do not like the term Ponzi is because there are a number of reasons it does not fit the definition.  Its not a pyramid scheme and of course there is a history of fraud in the origins of the term.  However there are those that think that the value store is zerosum outside speculation.  This means that when speculative forces end a cashout on speculative runs the only value that will remain is the value originally stored.  This will quickly be dumped to zero if there is no speculative pressure resulting in crash.  It would be nice to see an econometric model that shows the value changes of Bitcoin that arent based on speculative bubbles.  It would be great to see a model that explains the characteristics of the currency and its value volatility in some kind of legitimate way.  Unfortunately the characteristics of Bitcoin desire to hold value jumps on publicity no inherent value origin etc. are all characteristics of speculative bubbles.  In fact no econometric models show otherwise.  This is why most economists distrust any long term viability for Bitcoin.,2014-07-27T01:15:54.000Z,0.25

2902,1.0,0,I believe you should be worried and so should all of us. I mean I dont believe bitcoin to be a ponzi scheme I am invested in it but it is true that with the creator holding such a huge amount and its way more than  in contrast to other commentors replies it does look like one and very well could be one.   I mean the fact that he is presumably afraid of being tracked down could be just an excuse to convince people he is not ill intended. Every ponzi scheme needs to be convincing in some way no? And if it were true that he dissapeared by fear of the govenment and he really did create bitcoin because of his dislike of the banking system one would expect him to back it not let fear hang above users.   How could he do that without revealing himself? Many ways Just a quick idea Print paper wallets and anonymously send them as envelope mail to charity organizations or one to me as well it would be greatly appreciated . That would not only be untraceable but also good publicity. So why hasnt he done so?   Also people believe that if he wanted to cash out he would have done so when the price was over . but I dont think thats true. To a person with such large amounts price does not matter as much as market size does because when market size and trading volumes are so low as they are now only the first few bitcoins can be sold at the said price. The market at the time wasnt even big enough to absorb all the coins he would fail to sell them all even if he sold at .,2014-12-17T15:26:42.000Z,0.25

2921,1.0,0,Your absolutely right in everything you say my point is not to suggest they want this but that theyll be forced to compete with bitcoin.   Since it is possible to put the dollar on the block chain and offer every feature bitcoin does without giving up control over the quantity supply they will be forced by the free market to do it or lose everything.  The point of pegging it to the dollar is to give people the initial feeling of security that its not going to be volatile. The peg wouldnt last long as dollars become irrelevant and the traditional format was phased out in favour of the ones on the blockchain.   Thanks to bitcoin they dont have a choice about accepting a currency they cant inflate its here they adapt or they lose its simple. And they will try to adapt.. and the only path for that where they can keep some of their power is the one i described. A blockchain based dollar identical to bitcoin in every way except a government backed exchange rate and either a premine of the entire lot or more likely a protocol rule that lets them create and destroy coins into and out of circulation at will.,2014-10-26T16:22:20.000Z,0.25
2922,1.0,0,Its great youve written this you probably know but there are a few misleading things in there though.   These transactions are encrypted using Cryptology  Transactions arent really encrypted they are indeed signed which is just a number at the end that proves that the transaction was made by someone who owns the passwordprivate key for that account but everyone can view everyone elses transactions without any decrypting    Bitcoins are produced by the developers  This is not quite true as anyone can do this and rarely are developers who contribute to the bitcoin codebase.    Bitcoins are created by simply adding to someones balance a specific number of bitcoins in exchange for them helping in the process of verifying everyone elses transactions. The amount they get credited is very carefully worked out and is a major reason of why Bitcoin is so different to any other digital currency. It is a system that fairly picks someone at random with the chance of earning the new coins based on how much they helped the network over time.  These days specialized hardware is required so isnt viable to earn coins via mining without investing a lot of money up front.,2014-04-08T20:22:11.000Z,0.25
2923,1.0,0,In general I agree but for the most part securing your Bitcoin requires new thinking.  People have to develop a common sense about digital security.  If Bitcoin does go mainstream Im guessing some sort of bank will emerge that will manage your Bitcoin just like they manage your fiat money today.  Youll pay fees and get protection.  The good news is no one is forced to and hopefully two people one with a bank and one without will be able to transmit funds.,2014-05-16T13:31:35.000Z,0.5

2928,1.0,0,Theres a steep learningcurve to securing your own bitcoin and many novices cant trust themselves to do everything properly. Of course there are huge risks in trusting a rd party to store your bitcoins but sometimes those risks are lower for people who are less technologically savvy. Minus the MtGox debacle the majority of the horror stories you read about are from people who mess up trying to secure their own bitcoin.   If you feel like you can trust Coinbase to not disappear overnight then I think their vault is an excellent tool to use. At the very least its a nice option to have for people who are looking for an easy security solution.,2014-07-29T22:49:06.000Z,0.25

Weak federal government and stronger local governments that understand what the local people need.

2966,1.0,0,To be honest its set up as a gambling game. Its a gamble. Are people going to deposit after you? By definition a Ponzi Scheme is fraud. As hrponzi is  transparent and explains to the user that it is in fact a ponzilike system means that its not actually a ponzi scheme. A ponzi scheme would be something like Hey send me Bitcoin and Ill invest it in startups and then in a week Ill give you back . Deception is not involved in hourponzi.

2969,1.0,0,No BTC is like IP. Currently IPv is the dominant version that will become IPv in the future. Theyre based on the same concepts.  Its no different for BTC  a change to the core protocol would just be a new version of sorts which can be propagated and supersede the old Bitcoin protocol version. You dont need a separate protocol for that.  gt Dark Wallet is like tor and proxy services.  Which is a great solution until those things are integrated into the protocol itself.,2014-08-13T10:28:54.000Z,0.25
2970,1.0,0,Bitcoin Core has centralized control over who can commit to the official repository but anyone is free to access the code submit patches or fork it. Bitcoin Core serves as the reference implementation because of its direct lineage to Satoshis original code and the collective consent of the Bitcoin community.  Other implementations exist such as Bitcoinj. Because the Bitcoin network requires consistency between nodes these other implementations track Bitcoin Core on the protocol level. However if an implementation can establish better trust display better leadership or in any other way obtain the consent of a majority of the network they can become the new reference implementation.,2014-04-09T03:07:16.000Z,0.25
2971,1.0,0,Xoin  Good question.  A merchant can only stock activated Xoin vouchers once his account has been credited. Xoin distributes voucher batches. Merchants credit their account by referencing a unique batch number that they wish to activate.   These funds are not yet converted to Bitcoin. Only when a customer redeems a voucher then our backend executes a buy order at the realtime exchange rate. Essentially we will not activate Xoin vouchers that are not backed by available funds.  This works exactly the same as the South African airtime model for resellers  first topup before you can sell. Small store owners in South Africa are familiar with this model. Merchants are notified via sms when a batch is activated.  We have built in a mechanism to flag any vouchers that have been redeemed but not yet activated. Customers will be prompted to contact us if this happens. We will then also contact the merchant and investigate the situation.   Also customers are advised to only trust registered resellers.

2972,1.0,0,I dont worry about  amp  in the long term as theyre solved by the payment protocol hardware wallets and of multisig escrow services respectively.   deserves a longer response though  First understand that a lot of the lashing out was a defensive reaction to a large number of people once again proclaiming the death of Bitcoin itself  something a lot of people are both financially _and emotionally_ invested in.  While it should still be tactful its an understandable reaction to a long history of media cheap shots.  Second for getting others to act responsibly tough love and public ridicule for the irresponsible is _much_ more effective than an outpouring of public sympathy after they get burned.  While the latter may make us _look_ more caring real public education trumps public image here IMHO.,2014-03-05T18:53:02.000Z,0.25
2973,1.0,0,Wrong again. The market cap of Bitcoin is significantly higher than than the amount of external value that has gone into it. This new value is not generated out of thin air though it may seem so from casual observation.

2983,1.0,0,Using my Google Cache and its amazing ability to break paywalls  here is the article I found  In hopes of indoctrinating a new batch of believers Tony Cole set up two pieces of propaganda a leather blazer bedecked with hundreds of gold plastic coins bearing the bitcoin B and a Visionman bitcoin mining rig an intensely powerful piece of computer hardware capable of running millions of the algorithms that process bitcoin transactions each second.  Cole was there at a Mission District coworking space temporarily transformed into the Bitcoin for Beginners Fair to dazzle the crowd with all the mystery and possibility of virtual currency.  I just want to show people how it works he said offering up demonstrations of the rig. Consider him a bitcoin ambassador.  Bitcoin has gained steady acceptance among technology enthusiasts. The Bitcoin for Beginners Fair a monthly affair that kicked off Tuesday seeks to bring bitcoin to everyone else.  One of the main obstacles standing in bitcoins path to the mainstream Its confusing.  Its origin  and its still unidentified creator  is shrouded in mystery. It is also highly technical a peertopeer payment system crowdcontrolled by software and complicated algorithms rather than banks.  Most bitcoin events are for people who are very advanced in bitcoin said Ana Munoz of Mission Coworking which hosted the event. We wanted to reach people who are curious but without any knowledge at all.  What is bitcoin?  Jason Tan was one such curious guy.  Tan  who works on the business side of the tech industry knew about bitcoin but still didnt really understand what it was. He hoped he might find out.  Im just interested in seeing whats out there he said.  The event featured lectures by bitcoin experts who explained everything from the basics of how to set up a digital bitcoin wallet to how the security features of bitcoin work. It drew about  people  from business owners looking to begin accepting bitcoin as payment to artists interested in incorporating bitcoin into their work.  Cole was there to explain the insandouts of mining and he hoped possibly set some folks up with their own bitcoin mining machine priced he said at a bargainbasement .  Other vendors were on hand like Bitsoaps a company that makes scented soaps shaped like the bitcoin logo and Cointemporary an online art gallery for bitcoincentric works of art.  We just want people to see there is a market in which you can actually buy things with bitcoin said Bitsoaps purveyor Kyle Kariya who traveled from Los Angeles for the evening.  Bitcoin of course faces many challenges on its way to mainstream acceptance.  It was introduced in  but only began to achieve substantial use in the past two years. Estimates peg the number of bitcoin users to be somewhere between  million and  million people.  Volatile market  Its recent boost in public awareness has also increased suspicion  about the volatility of the bitcoin market which fluctuates wildly at times and about the security and stability of the bitcoin network.  But one thing is certain Bitcoin will probably never catch on if people first cant figure out what it is.  I started trying to figure it out but its all kind of confusing. I mean is it money or what? said Emil Reiman a property manager interested in starting his own bitcoin business. Im ready to learn more.,2014-06-05T22:05:41.000Z,0.25

3004,1.0,0,I can only concur. And imho Bitcoin needs a break after this turmoil. Bitcoin doesnt need the press to become successful it doesnt need another casinoexchange it doesnt need gossip or emotional outcries or factfree reporting like last week. I read articles by journalists who cant tell a bankruptcy from bankruptcy protection and I heard people declaring MtGox dead before even looking at the patient.   Bitcoin needs an economy it needs to be usable throughout an entire supply chain from consumer to farmer. And being able to pay your coffee at some hipster bar just isnt enough when the bar owner has to run to change his btc into dollars before some troll at Coindesk hi bitidiot decides to drop a bomb on another exchange just because he doesnt like it.   Bitcoin has become a high risk casino game driven by high impact gossip sold as news by clueless journalists. The more factfree reporting it will get the more volatility it will see the longer it will take before it is accepted as a serious alternative to fiat. If ever.,2014-03-01T11:11:01.000Z,0.25

3026,1.0,0,Thats a pretty large unproven theory to justify overpaying miners amp devaluing your own wealth.  The overpayment also encourages an attack because the attackers will be well rewarded before even attempting to be malicious.  A lot less incentives to reachstay at  if the pay is mediocre.  According to wikipedia China has the largest supercomputer at  petaFLOPS.  FoldingHome is currently at  petaFLOPS.  Thats VOLUNTARY distributed computing vs the backing of the Chinese government.  According to bitcoinwatch bitcoin is at  petaFLOPS.  Now bitcoin miners are paid a little too good but even if paid more reasonably we would still be much stronger than the worlds largest supercomputer.

3030,1.0,0,How would I get a false transaction into the current Bitcoin chain? I would publish the transaction and hope it gets picked up by a miner. Probably even before it gets picked up by a miner it would be dropped by full nodes who call bullshit on the transaction. Even if I published it directly to a miner they would verify it before publishing their block and call bullshit on the transaction. Then even if they didnt verify the transaction and ended up accepting it into their block other miners would call bullshit on them and reject their block continuing to mine off the previous block.   How would you fake a transaction with my system?  You would publish a transaction to the network. Once it hits the first full node they would call bullshit. So instead you publish to the lowest level miner  they have to either accept the transaction or deny it  if its fake they deny it. Say they do accept it for whatever insane reason then the superblock is mined. The superblock miner has to either accept or deny the subblock so he inspects the subblocks transaction lists and denys that subblock. This happens all the way up to the mainblock and the only way to get the network to accept this false transaction is if  of the miners at EACH LEVEL accept the block. So even if you owned ALL the mining at one level of mining you still couldnt accept false transactions. Each full node has to store every transaction and every subblock. So just like in the current system the miners have agreed upon a protocol by which theyll accept blocks. And just like in the current protocol if a miner decides to deviate from that protocol he wont be able to find a block because other miners and fullnodes will reject his blocks.  The lower target for the miners can be just as much proof as the higher current targets for miners  you just need more of it. It still proves that work was done to find blocks.  Yes it adds bloat. Yes it makes the blocktree bigger. There are advantages to that. Right now the longest blockchain is picked by the sum of the difficulties of all the blocks on it so really its the heaviest but in the case of a chain heaviest  longest  here you would sum the difficulties of all the main blocks  the difficulties of all the subblocks meaning to fake a main block from earlier in the blockchain you either have to fake the same amount of mainblocks which requires a lot of work or MANY MANY more subblocks which requires a lot of work. The current protocol isnt any different only all you have to do is fake mainblocks right now something that people are legitimately worried about GHash.io deciding to do. Here realistically you would have to have mining hardware NOT just in sha ASICs NOT just in scrypt equipment but also in whatever other equipment is needed to mine whatever other algos are used for subsubblocks. You could even do something simple like its the same process as the mainchain namely sha sums but you have to bitshift the prehash image first. It would be really simple to make sure people cant use the same calculations to mergemine each level of subblocks.  Another advantage is more granular decisions about how secure your transaction is  you could choose to wait for  level  blocks or  level  block or for hundreds of thousands of dollars  level  main blocks etc...   Anyway the main advantage is that it makes mining harder. It distributes the rewards for mining among people much much more and makes mining less profitable. It also allows us to tune how hard andor profitable it is directly and to push people into different groups of miners which subchains theyre mining based on that profitability.  The current system is too profitable for miners especially for people who can get other miners to group up and form pools. So here we dont just need it to be x the work we need it to be x the work or Mx however much more work it takes so that people who buy little ASIC rigs or have a graphics card can realistically find subblocks enough to make it appealing not to pool mine  right now the whole system is stacked against that idea. ONE block reward!? Going to ONE miner?! In an ENTIRE world of miners? Who wouldnt pool mine? We need a way to distribute those block rewards more evenly based on network hashrate  the current solution is pool mining.  If we make it more profitable to solomine vs group mining we wont have that issue. And sure we have ppool going and we have good people donating money to give miners incentive to mine using ppool  but a thats slapped on top of it not built directly in and b we cant and more importantly shouldnt count on people always treating Bitcoin ethically. In  years when its in wide use it will be like cars no one will want to look under the hood. Those that do wont understand the significance as much and probably wont care about the integrity of the network as much. To them finding a way to trick Bitcoin by gathering  hashing power may just be another scam they pull off. It should be built in from the start that that is prohibitively difficult to achieve and I think my system could be a step towards that direction.  So maybe this isnt the best way to distribute the block rewards. But it is A way to do it. If ppool was built directly in where the miners all worked on a separate much quicker blockchain to mine and the rest of the network full nodes and clients saw only the main blockchain which the miners threw blocks up onto occasionally as a group  and that was how you were forced to mine would it work? Still no. ppool accounts for a pretty small number of miners out there  if everyone went there wed have the same problem as now the difficulty of the ppool chain would rise and people would only occasionally find the reduced proofofwork necessary to garner any rewards and people would pool within the ppool. With my setup you could set it up so that a Ghs rig would always allow people to turn a small profit at SOME level in the mining hierarchy without pooling. With some tuningfeedback loops it could make it most profitable to compete against your peers hashrate wise  picking on people your own size essentially.,2014-01-16T07:18:53.000Z,0.25

3070,1.0,0,tldr you mine virtual coins using your GPU CPU is too inefficient. A very highend AMD card will make around day at best like right now and nvidia cards maybe half that at best they suck at OpenCL I believe. Youll get insanely high temps in the process imagine almost furmark levels running  for most people. This has lead to people putting together any AMD cards they can and mining the coins for a few dollars a day over  thatd add up to well over k from midrange cards and up.  What youre seeing is someones desperate attempts to get in on it. Technically he wouldnt be bitcoin mining but rather virtual coins any other coins out there as ASICs purposebuilt machines for bitcoin mining have made it unprofitable and ASICs cant do the other coins yet like litecoin digitalcoin dogecoin etc all listed on www.coinchoose.com if theyre major.

Checkpointing doesnt stop someone from refusing all transactions to a block. Proof of humanity isnt a thing afaik. Proof of stake can be defeated by someone holding enough of the currency  something banks can obviously do. Modifying the hashing algorithm doesnt and will never stop ASICs.  If Bitcoin ever becomes a threat to the banks the probability will be high that theyll attack it. Of course Bitcoin will never get to that level so the probability is low.

3095,1.0,0,They can regulate the points of exchange between fiat and bitcoin.  Anyone handling bitcoin on behalf of other people could be required to meet certain standards or else face penalties closure or criminal prosecution.  That would include exchanges payment companies ATM operators.   Most exchanges already are voluntarily complying or making a good effort to do so with KYC requirements that are imposed on traditional financial institutions which are mostly about moneylaundering prevention.,2014-02-28T12:58:23.000Z,0.25
3096,1.0,0,gtDigital currency is a special class of software that is even more vulnerable to fragmentation as it relies on digital scarcity to function.  Where does this idea come from?  If a competing coin is mined then it too would be scarce and although its presence might affect the price of a competitor it would not prevent it from functioning.  Also it seems to contravene the bitcoin movements ethos of monetary freedom or did I imagine that ethos?.  Ultimately I think having at least two fully independent competitors will only serve the best interests of both.  Besides decentralization means there is no way to enforce a monopoly.  If there is incentive to create and sustain an altcoin then imo theres nothing to stop it but the market.  gtAn altcoin can easily preserve the scarcity started by Bitcoin by simply using the same distribution scheme.  agreed  gtGiven Zerocoin is not focusing on innovations in means of distribution I dont see the risk of any significant harm from Zerocoin using mined bitcoin as its means of distribution  Such a pegging approach would be innovative and require absolute confidence in the nascent turbid and ultimately experimental Zerocoincash network.  Why not just let Zerocoin focus on one innovation at a time and allow risk takers to take risk?   Anyhow the same conversion can be accomplished with less pressure on an exchange without any artificial pegging.  gtI dont see the risk of any significant harm from Zerocoin using mined bitcoin as its means of distribution  Im pretty sure it would create extra pressure for the devs  gtand I see this alleviating major risks and bringing it some important benefits as well  Risks affecting bitcoins pricedeveloper base? Benefits not affecting bitcoins pricedeveloper base?  I dont get why Zerocoin was sidetracked for so long but now that they announce theyre going to create an experimental alt its seen as dangerous.,2014-01-20T03:52:42.000Z,0.25

The appropriate content would be a comparison of the estimated kWh usage of both the bitcoin and peercoin networks at steady state  years in the future perhaps but any number you put in would just be speculation at this point in time.  If you want to keep it one way to show that peercoin uses less energy than alternative coins is by showing that proof of stake uses far less energy than mining and currently creates a large portion of new peercoins.,2014-03-10T19:18:25.000Z,0.25

3106,1.0,0,What Is Huntercoin?  Huntercoin is a new altcoin that released at the beginning of February to little fanfare.  Huntercoin is based off of Namecoin and utilized a dual proofofwork algorithm to process Huntercoin transactions with both SHA and Scrypt devices.  Huntercoin is meant to be merged mined with other altcoins and should be immune to fluctuations in hardware efficiency.  That isnt even the most interesting part about Huntercoin mining.  Huntercoin blocks are  minute long and every block releases  Huntercoins.   HUC goes to the miners each block and . is distributed on the Huntercoin map.  The remaining . HUC goes to whichever Hunter has the crown.  The traditional mining scheme has been turned on its head by Huntercoin.  For the first time since the earliest days of Bitcoin any individual can mine meaningful amounts of crypto without dedicated hardware.  Furthermore Huntercoin is the worlds first MMO game that is decentralized and cannot be taken down or censored by any government or rating agency.,2014-03-08T00:45:57.000Z,0.25

3111,1.0,0,I thank you for that.    I like to introduce those who listen to my show about what I think is cool and new in technology things I think they should know and to answer their questions.  I have a deep believe crypto currencies are going to change all of our lives and I also dislike all the FUD surrounding Bitcoin which rubs off on the rest of the altcurrencies.   The other media folks who are not tech geeks or have axes to grind or corporate masters to please are putting out a lot of half truths and flat out wrong information about alt currencies and that upsets me!  On my show I tell it like it is I tell my listeners in plain language they can understand without a lot of jargon...and when I use jargon I explain it.  They can make up their own minds about topics I talk about but I give them the insiders look at things.   Kim Kamando is good with what she does but I want to do more and I want to respect my listeners as adults and not treat them like slow children as Kim often does.  Obviously I cant get too technical since I am on an AM station in the upper plains...so a lot of farmers and nontechies listen to the show...but I try to stay current and give them the full story about current techrelated news topics.

3116,1.0,0,Hey thanks I agree with the idea of market specific cryptos. To your point about how some people may not have enough fiat to get any bitcoin they could buy a small amount and purchase cheap things they need with it. Anyone can buy very small fractions of a bitcoin. What somebody in the third world would do is buy bitcoin in the millibits and spend microbits on their daily transactions. Food and shelter are much cheaper in developing parts of the world so they would just deal in smaller fractions of a bitcoin.   Overall I really like your analysis and I think you have a lot of strong thoughts on this subject.,2014-01-11T06:27:28.000Z,0.25
3117,1.0,0,Im taking off my usparekeycharity to reply to this one. These are my views and should have no reflection on Spare Key.  So I dont feel like I really fall into either the Libertarian bitcoin camp or the Venture Capitalist Bitcoin camp. Im interested in the idea of organizing labor through post internet methods like Dogecoin. I tend to agree with Gabe Newell when he says that Corporations are a preinternet way of organizing labor.   So Valve essentially functions in this way. But they have the luxury of being able to choose who joins the organization. We dont have that luxury. What we do have is a few devoted individuals who have developed promoted and built an infrastructure for doge. These people frequently get shouted at when they do something. I dont know why this is. We also have a couple dozen people participating in DogeDoge and those people are heroes.  This is how a decentralized labor force is going to work Everyone chooses how to spend their time and their Doge. Each person is responsible for figuring out what their talents are and how to apply them.   But oh my goodness we are gold. We are a marketers ultimate dream. Here we are willing to engage with brands for days at a time. NASCAR has never seen someone vote  times. Why do you think McDonalds has built a custom captcha for us? There isnt a fanbase on the planet that can promote brand engagement like we can.   But we can be so much more.   Theres a portion of Dogecoin users I would even venture to say a majority who are willing to spend money in order to support businesses in order to support the shibeconomy. Do you know how crazy that is? The Federal Reserve has literally been working since its inception to to try and get people to do this. Most people dont do this. The fact that we do this is a remarkable thing. Initiatives like DogeDoge and this users plan reading.,2014-05-29T04:10:12.000Z,0.25

The work that I compare to miners in the blockchain was only to cut transport and install the stonesbut not to keep track of the record.

3135,1.0,0,I dont think one can compare the potential growth of Ethereum with the past growth of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin now has  years of history and was the first of its kind.  The difference in inflationrates between the two will be far into the noise of uncertainty regarding future value.  Ethereums value is going to be largely determined by what kind of applications run on top of it if it is able to attract developer attention and what if any competition springs up around it.  If developers shun it a strong competitor emerges or the applications dont create any real value then the price of ether is likely to go down.  If developers adopt it the competition is weak and if the applications generate lots of value then the price of ether will likely rise in proportion.  Probably the only reasonable thing that can be said is that the price will be volatile for at least the first few years and that the volatility will greatly exceed the rate of inflation.,2014-07-25T04:15:59.000Z,0.25

You dont but say he is a merchant who wants to spend his funds without anyone eavesdropping on his transactions.

3186,2.0,0,Saying Bitcoin is a stock is a much less defensible position than calling it a currency. While its volatility makes its status as a currency suspect it is definitely not a controlling share in a corporation. You can make a reasonable argument for it being a commodity but even then someone will point out that it has no intrinsic value.  The reality is things are simply more complicated than perfectly defined categories. Ultimately if enough people call something a currency then it is one.

3188,2.0,0,I work in IT too.  Dont even try to tell me that every single thing done in IT regardless of what industry were in is superior to all others that we act with moral righteousness at all times.    Im not making a loose arbitrary connection between computers and acts of negativity.  Our professions very existence is squeezing the lifeblood out of people getting as much productivity out of them and increasing the bottom line with as minimal investment as possible.    You ever been involved in a termination?  You ever get the call to disable someones AD account and send a remote wipe to all their devices?  Were you privy to the reason?  Maybe they were downloading CP onto the file server maybe they were running a bitcoin miner maybe they ran afoul of the CEOs pet project maybe theyre just being downsizedmade redundant.    What you and I do is make it easier for people to make more money plain and simple.  Were white collar workers and we apply our skill set to make money and survive.  If you like your job and what you do awesome good on you congratulations.    You dont enforce any laws.  You never took a drunk driver off the road.  Sure you never decided that youd vent your stress on a bunch of hippies you never acted in schadenfreude to pull over someone doing  in a  zone to meet your quota etc.  But in the grand scheme of things nobody  no human being that exists probably short of Mother Teresa or other people who literally give their entire lives to work for charity and the betterment of lives  is in a position to take a moral high ground over the position of people in law enforcement.  Yeah theyre going to have to enforce all the laws  that is literally their job the position of the police in civil society.  Police enforce the laws lawmakers make laws courts interpret laws.  You are free to enter any of those professions if you want to change things to vote for people who share your viewpoints in those since they are matters of public democracy and to say how much you hate the guy in office who doesnt share your views or who you didnt vote for that got elected.    But also youre free to have your opinion called out as flawed  you base your reasoning on a premise of because some laws are unjustwrongoutdatedstupid all law enforcement officers are horrible people who exist to make sure fines are collected.    Id argue that if your premise is the above as you state because police dont protect everyone in real time and some laws are unjust therefore all police are useless at best and awful brutes at worst then the converse is better no?

3217,2.0,0,I live in China and have been using PayPal for such transfers.  The whole wire transfer thing was a big pain in the ass for me also. Yesterday I tested using Bitcoin with Coinbase.com which seems to cleared all the AML and KYC hurdles in the USA.   Because I havent a Visa credit card to link to my Coinbase account there is  day delay between the time I withdraw from Coinbase and the time its deposited into my US bank account. With PayPal its seldom more than  business days.  PayPal charges about  for the international transfer. With Bitcoin there are no such fees. Coinbase and my bank Ally charge only . for the electronic deposit. So of course using Bitcoin will be cheaper in the long run.  Some banks seem OK with Bitcoin business. Others not so much. Id suggest asking your BoA branch manager before you attempt a Bitcoin transfer. As for other banks Ally seems to be cool with my transfers to and from Coinbase but they have been very small  less than .   As for the bank vs. credit union question it should make no difference for using Coinbase. The big question is whether your bank or credit union will permit Bitcoin transfers.,2014-02-03T14:16:29.000Z,0.25

3222,2.0,0,The reason its been such a nonissue in practice is because probably Greater than . of transactions are conducted online rather than in a retail environment. And its essentially impossible to doublespend an online purchases you order something from Overstock and then succesfully respend those coins overstock will see that your transaction didnt confirm and not ship your order.   Once Bitcoin has more of a presence in retail environments Id expect to see android apps specifically built to attempt doublespends  Youd set up your app with the address you want your coins sent to set whether the app should attempty its double spend automatically after X seconds or wait for user interaction. Lastly it would need to have a relatively large list of Bitcoin nodes loaded regularly.   User would go to the tiger direct store make a purchase and broadcast it to a single node with a . transaction fee. Tigerdirects computer notes an unconfirmed transaction to the address they supplied you with and says youre good. A second later you press the doublespend button and your phone broadcasts a new transaction to  nodes spending the same exact coins you sent to tigerdirect to the second address which is under your control along with a . btc transaction fee just to be extreme  Nothkngs ever  but youd have two potential end results. Either you receive the product you purchased and the bitcoins you used have successfully been transferred to tiger direct OR you leave the store with your  product and the mining pools opt to include the transaction you sent to yourself on account of the vastly larger transaction fee you included. You leave the store with your  product and have only spend . for it.   Unless someone cares to explain why this wouldnt work Ill go ahead believing that the lack of successful doublespends is not due to the impossibility of conducting one its due to the dearth of opportunities to actually pull one off. Once more retailers start accepting Bitcoin at the register someone will certainly build a tool like the one I explained or figure out a better approach.  Thats how I see things at least.,2014-11-25T18:22:33.000Z,0.25

3226,2.0,0,I wholeheartedly agree with Daniel on that point but Im not sure its possible to implement something like Maidsafe using bitcoin. The system depends on rewarding contributors with a token meaning it has to have its own builtin inflation mechanism and that just cant be done with bitcoin. So my guess is that Maidsafe appcoins will be worth about as much as it actually costs to rent storage space on the Maidsafe system even if everyone constantly sells Maidsafe coins and only buys them as a method of being able to pay the system rent.,2014-12-26T21:17:59.000Z,0.25

There seems to be a loose consensus that we would prefer to use a more traditionally denominated currency that wasnt so decimal heavy.  dollar   cents that is known.  BTC   satoshis and that is known. The big hullabaloo is if we should make BTC the base unit and call it something that people can identify with. The real point of contention is what we would call BTC if BTC were to become the new base unit. I dont know the answer but I think one will evolve over time similar to how language evolves.,2014-05-05T19:10:41.000Z,0.25

3268,2.0,0,If BitGo goes down who use the of model with two keys needed either one key from the user and one key from BitGo or two keys from the user the user can still access his Bitcoin using his backup key.  If GreenAddress.it goes down who use the of model with one key needed from each side the user can still access his Bitcoin with only the same one key after some time thanks to the nLockTime feature.  So in both cases if the user is hacked someone gets his key and can get past his FA and the service is not down the hacker can access the Bitcoin with the users key.  Now with the of model of BitGo if both the two user keys get hacked stored at the same place from the user the hacker can access the Bitcoin even without having to get past the users FA for BitGo? Because he already has two keys?  But with GreenAddress.it the hacker who got the users key also has to hack the users FA for GreenAddress.it to access the Bitcoin?  To access the Bitcoin of a GreenAddress.it user the attacker has to hack the GreenAddress.it server which stores one side of the two keys AND the GreenAddress.it user and his FA for GreenAddress.it?  OR  The hacker has to get the encrypted private keys from the the GreenAddress.it server and shut the server down and hack the user and his other Bitcoin address where the Bitcoin are moved with nLockTime?

3287,2.0,0,In the field of computer science theres a type of algorithm called a hashing algorithm.  This type of algorithm takes a number performs a bunch of math on it and spits out a fixedlength number called a hash.  The trick here is that hashing functions are oneway.  In other words theres no algorithm you can apply that will take a hash and produce the original number.  The reasons for this are probably beyond what can be easily explained in an ELI manner but the best analogy I can make is mixing paint.    Lets say that you have a series of  dabs of paint on a canvas.  Now lets say that you do the following  . Mix a little bit of colors  and  and call this color A.  . Mix a little bit of colors  and  and call this color B.  . Mix a little bit of  and A and call his color A.  . Mix a little bit of colors  and A and call this color A.  . Mix a little bit of  and B and call his color B.  . Mix a little bit of colors  and B and call this color B.  . Mix a little bit of colors A and B . . . etc.  At the end you throw away certain specific ones of the intermediate colors and keep others.  The sequence of colors that you end up with is the hash of the original colors.  If you start with the same colors in the same order youll always end up with the same hash but its virtually impossible to look at the final output of mixed colors and predict what the original colors were.  The only way to find out if a certain hash is produced by a certain set of starting colors is to actually perform the hash and see what you get.  So back to Bitcoin.  A bitcoin is a number that has an interesting hash using the SHA hashing algorithm.  Specifically if you hash a number and the resulting hash starts with a string of zeroes that original number is a bitcoin.  But since you cant reverse hashes you have to literally try hashing every number ever to try to find out which ones are bitcoins.  And these arent small numbers.  Were talking about numbers thousands of digits long. Even for a computer this is a very timeconsuming process. But once you have a bitcoin its trivial to say Hey this is a bitcoin just hash it and see.,2014-03-06T14:59:20.000Z,0.25

It probably doesnt belong here at least not in this extend ... My main arguments as already stated are in very short form governments and banks wont ever allow a decentralized anonymous currency to become mainstream or even rival their own fiat currency and they have the fully power to beat it back to its hole if necessary and Bitcoin will lose its momentum long before it becomes secure and convenient enough that normal people start using it who furthermore will personally see no advantage to do so in comparison to how they pay  store their wealth  whatever you think Bitcoin will make significantly better on a broad front today. The fact that most here including me see Bitcoin as a speculative vehicle to make money  for the totally wrong reason additionally underlines in my eyes the fate to expect for Bitcoin.  Again this is just a VERY short version and Im no native speaker so sorry for that. Im pretty sure you will think even more now that I simply dont understand Bitcoin and its protocol.

Just a personal preference really.    Also that being the case.  A person could get half of this done for them by using one of the many bitcoin payout multipools and then just buying reddcoin.  Unless of course they thought the theoretical operator of this new pool would be able to get a better return per Mhash which is probably unlikely considering the time and effort the well established multipool operators have put into it.  tldr The end result could be accomplished with a lot less effort than setting up a whole automated system for this.,2014-04-02T02:19:26.000Z,0.25

3320,2.0,0,Hmm there are two reasons I can think of.  Reason  luck.  Youre competing against everyone else whos trying to mint coins and sometimes you get it and sometimes you dont.  Reason  you might be running into a feature of the bitcoin protocol which deals with change.  I find it a little confusing but basically if you send a transaction it will send more than youve actually requested based on the last transaction and the remainder will be automatically routed back to you via a change address.

3328,3.0,0,i dislike censorship more than i dislike handing out other peoples private material.  i also dont hate giving out stolen material as much as most people do i view it as a lesson in the necessity to learn better privacy tactics.  for example in bitcoin if your private key gets compromised youre fucked theres no recourse.  theres no insurance or way to get your money back.  and while that means some people get screwed it also means that bitcoin isnt compromised by trying to balance one persons notions of right and fair against the slippery slope of undoing a transaction.  the system is rigid.  the protocol is the protocol.  a valid transaction is a valid transaction.  and thats how i like it.  my money is my responsibility and i know that the protocol remains secure.  similarly as much as it sucks that peoples private photos got leaked thats a risk they take when they use technology without taking the time to learn precautions.  any time you dont know enough to do something yourself you must inevitably place your trust in somebody else to do it for you and sometimes that other party will let you down.  thats the way of the world.  apple fucked up it happens.  spreading around jennifer lawrence nudes is a cold hard reminder that rd party services arent perfect.  ive already seen two posts by people asking how they can protect their own photos from the same fate.  people who became interested in learning how to protect themselves because they finally realized how vulnerable they were.  i think thats a net benefit even if jlaw may feel differently.  for that and many other reasons i am against the censorship of those subs and almost all if not all censorship in general.  rprivacy to me at least is about promoting the ideas and reasoning behind wanting privacy standards to be defaults and also about passing on the technology for individuals to ensure privacy for themselves.  its about protecting information.  however once information is out its out and when its out it is the right of the people to access it.  trying to contain or censor information is far more problematic and leads to far more dangerous things than it is worth to protect the few people who are harmed by accidental information leakage.  censorship is wrong in almost every circumstance plain and simple.  thats why encryption and privacy tools must by necessity be so good and thorough because once the information is leaked it is no longer yours to protect nor should it be.  your photos are yours... until they arent and once they arent yours any more they are the peoples.  its like the bitcoin private key thing the integrity of the system is more important than an individuals mistakes.  internet censorship fucks with the core protocol of the internet the propagation of information.  once something is on the internet its no longer yours.  you have a right to protect your information but if you fail to protect it and it gets loose you lose the rights to it.  i understand thats a view many people wont like but its both the reality of the internet and i genuinely believe its the most moral stance.  the integrity of the system cannot and should not be compromised just because mistakes are sometimes made.  any time the integrity of the protocol is breached it paves the road for corruption and other harms.  it sets precedent for some authority to decide what information people can access.  and nobody should have that power.,2014-09-09T02:47:52.000Z,0.25

3338,3.0,0,The numerical reason is the block reward gets cut in half every  blocks.  It started at  is now  will be . at block  etc.  The sum of ..... is  and since there are  blocks in each interval we have a total of  x   .  The software reason is network nodes check new blocks for having the correct number for the generation transaction which sends coins to the miners address from no input newly created coins.  Unless a majority of nodes changes the software to follow a different formula blocks would be rejected and not passed along to other nodes.  A miner can put whatever they want in a block but if the rest of the network rejects it they wasted their time.  The economics reason is that Satoshi Nakamoto thought a finite money supply would prevent devaluation and encourage adoption.  As demand goes up against a finite supply each bitcoin should rise in value making them desirable.  Without a government to force you to use a particular currency bitcoin had to be desirable on its own merits to gain traction.,2014-03-03T15:47:29.000Z,0.25

In other words  remember how the internet enabled us to talk and collaborate with other individuals all over the globe? Now you can just as easily do business with them buy them a beer etc.  Use cases where Bitcoin would have come real handy if the exchange infrastructure where more distributed Large international money orders because holy shit look at those fees.  I would really love to see more cryptocurrency acceptance and stability because the legacy banking  credit card system just feels sluggish and bloated in comparison. In my opinion of course.  Regarding your concrete questions  . Currently only fringe cases such as pp business. For traditional eCommerce it probably makes little sense at the moment other than giving it a try. Additional cost is neglible if you overcome the initial learning curve.  . In case of widespread adoption Store of value instant transaction times global pp business no need to exchange in local currencies.  . Fraud protection can be implemented using a multisig escrow system. Not sure about what cash back price matching and other perks entail as Im not familiar with American CC offers but Im pretty sure that either you or the merchant pay for it in the end which means well you pay for it in the end.,2014-03-13T01:47:37.000Z,0.25

You need a clear and consise statement as to what your plan is to help the people of Botswana by integrating bitcoin in their lives not a referral to become another twitter follower.   Id like to offer some ideas to you that could be good for boosting ecommerce in botswana. Id be interested in what sort of art or goods botswanans make that is a refelction of botswanan culture. Right now if i wanted to buy botswanan art id probably have to go to Botswana or find an importer here in the United States. Heres where you come in you could help set up small businesses where local artists could sell their goods internationally via payments trough bitcoin. This would allow them to join the ecommerce realm while maintaining independence from banks allowing these merchants to be masters of their own financial destiny.   Implement this and its what we call in the United States a win win situation. You win because your quest to help people in your nation could be fulfilled they win because you help them make bitcoin. We win because bitcoin grows. So maybe its a win win win situation haha.   Ok good luck. FORM YOUR PLAN! I know you want to start a charity but you need a business plan.

However I think the precise numbers of specie in the system are irrelevant.  To me the most important part is that those numbers are immune from corruption and political influence.  In my opinion no central bank will ever be able to achieve this absolute power corrupting absolutely and such.  Giving freshly printed dollars to a particular class of individuals year after year for a century creates the  kind of dichotomy seen today.   I believe a hard protocol is the best way to avoid the pitfalls of poor central economic planning.  If the length of the meter remains the same year after year engineers can keep building bridges.  As long as entrepreneurs investors savers and spenders have a clear idea of how much their currency will be worth in the future whether gently deflationary or inflationary significant economic depressions can be avoided.    Fortunately bitcoin has given the world a choice  to keep existing traditional currencies and their electronic transfer methods or bitcoin.

3356,3.0,0,This is what I sent them  Dear   I think it would be a good idea for Amazon to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. Since several Amazon websites are also accepting orders from customers from abroad that are already paying in a different currency f.e. UKs website accepts Central European customers that pay in Euro accepting Bitcoin will make Amazon even more accessible. Also being a webshop that also offers digital goods accepting digital money makes it possible for your customers to do their entire shopping online. There are people that want this and they will shop wherever they can do so.  But first and foremost Mastercard and Visa charge horribly large fees. Using Bitcoin incurs a  fee for you or a very low fee if you will be using a Bitcoin payment processor. f.e. BitPay works with plans and charges no fees at all  The choice of Bitcoin is logical for any healthy online business nowadays and those that realise this first will be the first to profit and build reputation in the digital currency space.

For example I might be standing in the store waiting to buy something I trying sneaking by without paying any fee and then after  minutes it gets rejected. I then try again with a minimimal fee and it gets rejected again. Now Ive been in the store for  minutes wanting to make a simple purchase. Do I follow this right?,2014-06-16T18:48:40.000Z,0.25

The Venezuelan government completely controls money supply in Venezuela and this is the root cause of all the problems in the country. Our country has historically been managed through devaluation by the BCV.  If Venezuelans were in control of their currency Maduro would have absolutely no power. Thered be a powerful media with the means to shut him down thered be organizations taking care of all the issues but without a currency worth anything no sector of society can take matters into their own hands so yes Governments can control money supply centralized money supply is centralized for that very reason.  They strangle the main dollar supply coming from the oil rent what gets in outside their power is just a trickle from individuals and rare companies that somehow still want to do business in that environment.  You say it yourself they can only access other currency to a black market thats created precisely because of the rules they have imposed.  And yes thats the goal we want you to stop taking US Dollars and start transacting directly in Bitcoins charge people outside the US in bitcoins then if you want to convert them to UD Dollars just go to Gyft.com and buy gift cards as the easiest way to do it without having a US Bank account or sell them for USDEuro in Bitcoin exchanges abroad.,2014-11-21T15:51:36.000Z,0.25
3388,3.0,0,gt Let be honest average joe doesnt understand how TCPIP works. There is clear reason to use the internet or bitcoin but you cant explain it to average joe and hope they will understand.  I am so sick of hearing this.  Back in the Dark Ages earlymid s there were far more computer illiterate people than now.  Yet never was there a problem explaining to anyone why Email would be revolutionary.  Nor was there ever a problem explaining why computers and the internet would be useful to anyone.  It could easily be done in one sentence.  Imagine sending mail today and having your relative receive it today and you dont even have to pay USPS.  That was all that needed to be said.  Now try explaining why Bitcoin is usefulrevolutionarywhatever adjective you like in  sentence or less.  All this debate about naysayers in the s was really about people not convinced the world would change as much as it has.  No one worth taking seriously ever said Email is a fad or Email is a solution in search of a problem like they do with Bitcoin.  After all the difference between getting mail today and next Monday is significant and easy to display as is sending mail for free.    Getting a  off discount is also significant and easy to display.  Of course its also an argument for why Bitcoin is fundamentally useless. If you need to pay people to use a service its proponents maintain is as revolutionary as internet in the s then its not very revolutionary or even useful.,2014-07-23T22:31:58.000Z,0.25

3395,3.0,0,Whats in the blockchain isnt ever interpreted as machine code so even if someone somehow injected a binary malware on the blockchain it wouldnt do anything. Except perhaps make antivirus software freak out.  Something similar happened last week when someone crafted a transaction that included a few bytes of a known malware within its payload. Nothing that could ever run but enough that Microsoft Security Essentials was deleting a chunk of the blockchain that was getting downloaded which was causing the bitcoin client to download it again yielding the same results in a loop.  If we open our mind a bit further the blockchain is processed by programs. If those programs are poorly written they might have bugs that could result in buffer overflows and other security issues when exposed to unexpected blockchain data.   Thats generally thought to be an unlikely scenario.,2014-05-23T04:31:07.000Z,0.0

3399,3.0,0,gt  they look at current price and figure out how much they can reasonably scam people into paying for cloud hashing aka your own bitcoins back at a reduced rate over time.  So it stands to reason mining companies are making a bomb and if they are sensible dumping the coins for good old USD.  You think they are selling that cloud mining at a loss or something?  What I cant believe is how people are upvoting you when you only criticize and show nothing to prove the model is flawed.  The model should be as simple as this If Cex.io can offer cloud hashing at or below the current price of bitcoin then it MUST be cheaper for them to mine coins therefore mining has a negative impact on price otherwise why would I throw away  profit today when I can mine a coin for  and sell it for .   Hell if I wanted to actually make money Id short that one bitcoin I mined for  until my cost to mine reaches parity with current price.

3407,3.0,0,Pretty cool. Clearest explanation yet I have seen from the team about the basic premise for Ethereum from . to ...  From this viewing very excited about the level of abstraction the protocol promises for V.. If anyone has any doubts about how far ahead the vision is for Ethereum as compared to bitcoin and other projects today this presentation should dispel it IMO. Not to write bitcoin off as a currencyvalue store  I can eventually see bitcoin as the grandaddy of cryptocurrencies falling neatly into the Ethereum trust superstructure.  Currency follows trust not the other way round. So it make sense to build a trust network first if you want to have a significant impact on the way things are run now which is what excites me about the direction Ethereum is taking.   In my take it is less about that a trustless society more about making it easier to trust good players individuals or groups by providing an infrastructure that is transparent and accountable to the many... Everything good around you was created and is sustained by trust  we need more of it not less.  I particularly liked the phrase by Gavin It is about lowering barriers and that is good right? or words to that effect.

3409,3.0,0,From warrens post nd post on the thread  gtFurthermore it is doubtful that escalating N would be truly ASIC proof.  Since the deployment schedule of future N is known nearterm ASICs could cut costs as they need not implement distant future N in hardware because early generation custom hardware will be unable to compete on power cost with later generation custom hardware.  If you read through this carefully neither point that he states makes sense. The deployment schedule for Vertcoins N value is only a guideline. If I understand correctly it can be changed at any time if the developers choose to do so. Hes essentially saying that  lowN ASICs need not be built to perform like highN ASICs because lowN ASICs wont be able to compete with highN ASICs. I dont even understand what he means by that...  Another quote from warren  gtOthers have attempted to solve the issue of greater propagation latency with a new PoW that is very memoryhard to mine but not to verify and thus fast to validate.  That was the goal of Bitshares Momentum.  Unfortunately for them many of their past designs were broken within minutes on the Bitcoin forum. This demonstrates how hazardous it can be to implement your own algorithm.  Hes essentially dont bother trying to make a fast verify because youll probably screw it up. Thats not even a reason!  Last quote  gtIn these examples they made hashes more complex and increased the cost of ASIC development but if your coin becomes popular enough then ASICs become economically feasible.  Yes they become economically feasible... until they arent because you upped the N value!,2014-03-31T16:47:47.000Z,0.25

3415,4.0,0,I watched Bitcoin slide from  to  amid widespread negativity and held..  I also bought some more when it was down.  That your particular flavour of copycoinoverkillcoin is currently down in value isnt the problem in itself  thats just going to happen sometimes.  The problem is that most alts serve only to attempt to duplicate the wealth creation aspect and most people in the altcoin herds are ignorant of the massive battle in PR Bitcoin has fought tooth and nail just to get this far.. even in winning over parts of the tech community  let alone the general public.    For example the immutability of the Million limit was a tough concept to get across. There iswas deep suspicion from even semitechnical people that this could be changed... that there is some sort of shadowy controller who could just flip it to something else.  Having finally or mostly got the message across about how immutable this is for Bitcoin  along comes dogecoin playing fastandloose with their coin cap  and worse  doing it effectively by decree from what amounts to a pack leader. Yes  I know it wasnt actually a code change  but the publicly declared limit changing is the same issue  We had to argue tirelessly that the mill limit wasnt going to be irrelevant due to a thousand copycat clones making the effective coin cap of cryptocurrency limitless.  This was largely based on the idea that Bitcoin has a big enough head start and momentum and a core of devited enthusiasts amp developers who were building real infrastructure that couldnt just be duplicated like a software project.  Along comes dogecoin and shows that you can get a pack of people to drool over an infrastructureless phenomenon and publicly urinate over every Bitcoin thread they come across. It seems theyre oblivious to how their cheery ..and dogecoin too!  interruptions to serious attempts to sway merchants are damaging.    Dogecoin is impressive from a marketing and socialviral standpoint.  Its a shame it wasnt simply implemented as a wrapper around Satoshis as then it could have enjoyed the use of all the existing infrastructure without hurting it so much. though we probably have the mining difficulty and shascrypt mining divide to thank for the proliferation of new chains  If doge maintains its social momentum  then presumably the infrastructure will gradually come too... at least on the software side  though it remains to be seen if itll ever attract the sort of infrastructure that Bitcoin VCs are beginning to fund.  Back to your question.. people didnt know I was going to get Bitcoin before I did  and when it was going up  they kept saying  oh.. wish Id bought earlier  but its too late now  ie at BTC amp BTC When BTC prices go down.. some of my friendsfamily have bought a little.. but many seem to think each dip is the end.. or else they just never get around to it.  I just cant seem to get interested in springing even Million satoshis to get what.. roughly  Million Dogecoins...  even though Ive thrown hundreds of Bitcoins into other risky ventures... so perhaps the way I view Doge is similar to how many outsiders view Bitcoin.   I personally wish you good luck  though I think investinginpromoting dogecoin amp other noninnovative alts is a potential road to a tragedyofthecommons which impoverishes cryptocurrency  through dilution of focus and trashing of previous PR work in getting people to take Bitcoin seriously.  I hope Im wrong though,2014-04-02T03:55:17.000Z,0.25

3417,4.0,0,Generalizations are cool. s  There is a huge difference between merely accepting limitedreasonable regulations and inviting everincreasing direct government intervention.  Jeremy Allaire is out there doing the latter.  If he had his way each and every bitcoin transaction by a U.S. citizen would be tracked attributed and provided to FinCEN for analysis.  Your assumption that everyone who wants some anonymity and a lack of government insight into every aspect of our lives has something to hide is severely flawed.    I pay all my taxes Im not a criminal I dont do drugs I dont gamble and I dont launder money  yet Id be A LOT happier if the government left me and bitcoin completely alone.  Im realistic enough to know that wont happen so Id also support anyone who understands and accepts LIMITED regulations  while fighting really hard to limit and curb those regulations at every turn.  However I cannot and will not tolerate those who come into this space and then proceed to call for more and more regulations in an obvious attempt to make themselves richer at the expense of everyone else rights.

3432,4.0,0,gt  I essentially have no way to gauge if  ethers per bitcoin is a remotely good price or not!  It doesnt matter what number of ethers they picked.  They could have picked  or  million.  They picked two thousand but the math works out the same no matter which number was chosen.  They will sell as many as people want to buy over the  day sale period with a better price for people in the first  weeks and an increasing price per ether as the  weeks go by.  Then the inflation schedule is dictated by the number that was purchased at  of that initial purchase amount per year so a constant inflation amount which equates to a declining annual inflation percentage.  Buying ether is a bet that the Ethereum system will show increasing promise.  Given that its etherware now but smart people working on it with high incentive many people are making that bet.

3437,5.0,0,Great comment. Let me address this though since you seem to have overlooked something crucial  gtIf all of the worlds evergrowing newlyproduced wealth is represented by a fixed supply of  million coins its over centuries increasingly unfairly distributed compared to new wealth creation by new bright young things or even worth said new wealth creation might not even happen or on a much smaller much less desirable scale. Is it a perfectly fair way of redistribution? Well theres no such thing. Is it comparatively fairer than deflation rewarding nonproductive hoarders?   Deflation cannot reward nonproductive hoarders because the money itself confers no benefits upon the holder until it is spent. There are no rewards until you spend your coins. And once you do theyre back in the economy circulating and no longer yielding you wealthreturns.  Thats the beauty of Bitcoin and why deflation is not some nasty bogeyman waiting to ruin our lives.  Hoarding is just a negativelyconnoted term that boils down to saving and in all honesty hoard should never really be used to refer to money. If you earnedacquired money you are free to do with it what you wish. No one should be able to tell you how or when you should spend it and if you want to hold onto it for a future date or occasion you should not be punished for your patience.,2014-03-13T16:43:22.000Z,0.25

3439,5.0,0,Hi look I think the important point is that while on the one hand people should recognize that there is a  chance these coins are gone there are some credible scenarios such as the one described that might allow some coins to be retrieved. Because the stakes are so high we should not delay investigating to determine whether this is the case. In particular if the possibility I describe has occurred if the faulty code andor broken keys are lost it would make it much harder or impossible to retrieve the coins. Since this scenario and even others are possible  the BTFC and main players need to investigate andor facilitate investigation by experts ASAP. There are numerous people in the bitcoin space including myself with deep engineering backgrounds who would descend on this problem given a chance.   What I would like to do is  point out that there is at least a sliver of a chance of improving the situation by taking certain actions  rally some pressure on the BTFC and main players to follow up. Nobody should raise false hopes nor have false hopes but for reasons of completeness I think it is reasonable to demand we exhaust all possible lines that might help the situation.,2014-03-01T04:06:03.000Z,0.25
3440,5.0,0,The most important cryptography in bitcoin is SHA hashing and ECDSA signatures. Theres also RIPEMD hashing which provides additional security between public key and public address.  If ECDSA is brokencracked all transactions to addresses that have already been used will be compromised and can be readily stolen when you send a transaction you expose your public key. Seeing that were moving to HD addresses and are actively implementing software that doesnt reuse addresses its likely well not reuse an address anymore in the shortterm. ECDSA being broken by itself is therefore not a single point of failure anymore.  If SHA is broken nothing is compromised because youll still need to break ECDSA and RIPEMD. If RIPEMD is broken nothing is compromised because youll still need to break SHA and ECDSA.  If all three are broken the entire protocol is compromised.  If at any time any of the three algorithms are broken we can replace them with some effort and consensus.    As for mining the difficulty is adjusted every  weeks and this can be scaled up approaching infinity regardless of the power of the network it could be  times stronger than today and still work fine. We may however want to change the mining algorithm proofofwork also using SHA to an algorithm where shortcuts are theoritically disproven Im not sure if there are any.,2014-11-10T14:26:16.000Z,0.25
3441,5.0,0,There is no transaction ID in the Bitcoin protocol but a transaction Hash. To make it more clear you need to understand that a transaction has an input and an output.   The input is composed of the hash of the previous transaction and the signature script that will prove you are the owner of the coins. As you can note there is no input amount because the entire provision of the address will be spend. The change will be send back to you in the transaction output.   The output is composed of an amount and a signature script. In this case the signature script gives the condition that needs to be filled to unlock the coins.

If we are sharing our wild guesses  it is being reported as a disaster so that now when the hash rate bounces back people will know to panic sell.

The only chance you have is that a court realizes that ledger book to be legitimate and then allows people in that ledger book to put claims on assets as any other creditor could.  Youll get paid probably mBTCs on the bitcoin but youll get paid.  Eventually.   Thats the best case scenario.  The worst case scenario is that they dont count the BTC lost or listed in the ledger book at all as assets convert what is left to cash and use that to pay creditors of which youre not listed because the ledger book wouldnt count.

3458,5.0,0,gt And even the supply of Bitcoin can be expanded at will in the future if the majority of the miners agree to do so.  This isnt nearly as realistic a strategy as youre making it sound.  Sure the current miners can control consensus via SHA hashing if they collude.  But the rest of the network gets to decide which hashing algorithm they accept as proofofwork for the protocol they call bitcoin.  And the rest of the network merchants spenders savers exchanges services is what gives the network the vast majority of its economic value and utility.  Proofofwork algorithms are arbitrary and interchangeable the rest of the network is not.  If miners abuse their power they could quickly find themselves mining an algorithm thats no longer being used for anything of value.    Bitcoin supply will be limited so long as the economic majority not the mining majority wants to keep it that way.  Some might say that a fork to a different algorithm would no longer be bitcoin but Id say that whatever keeps the economic activity including a continuation of the ledger and original promises of bitcoin is bitcoin and will be known as bitcoin.  The specific proofofwork algorithm is irrelevant.,2014-12-28T18:58:00.000Z,0.25

3501,8.0,0,Shes really cute thats for sure.  And its awesome to see some passion really great.  I just think this level of politik about Bitcoin is a little premature.  The protocol itself is still in development.  Id say in programming terms its in alpha as new features are still being added.  Its not anywhere near ready for mainstream adoption.  The protocols systems rules etiquette and agreement about how Bitcoin works are still being formed.  There is much work to be done and an entire global infrastructure needs to be created.  Its still really early days its been amazing to see the support Bitcoin has received so far but in terms of the journey its not even  of the way there.  The general average Joe shouldnt be considering Bitcoin as anything more than an idea at this point.  We should welcome his criticism and address his concerns.  Its not time to criticize or belittle people for feeling comfortable with the system they have which for all intents and purposes works pretty well.  Its time to evangelize to spread the word and to sell the dream.  There are some huge unanswered questions.  Compare Bitcoin to a credit card well yes it does allow you to buy things online but it doesnt inherently provide me with credit.  It doesnt protect me from fraudulent merchants.  Compare it to a currency well people have voted for governments around the world who create and control our currencies on our behalf.  Its not as if we dont like or want the current system.  Bitcoin might be different but there isnt yet a strong case that its better.  The great thing about fiat is that it isnt real.  A bank doesnt need to have actual money to lend you they can create it.  Can you imagine applying for a home loan and the bank saying well youre approved but youll have to wait until we can mine some more coins before we can lend them to you... could be a while  So I really like this video.  I really do.  But I like it for its energy rather than its message which isnt going to resonate.  How long did it take to go from sparkly rocks and seashells to coins?  How long for banks?  How long for the incredible amazing invention that is fiat currency?  For the people who usually cant agree on what temperature it is that this note is worth this much?  Gonna take time people.  No need to rush.  This journey is going to be very long and the story will be barley told by the time we are all dead.,2014-09-08T14:07:55.000Z,0.25

3503,8.0,0,Nothing has prevented the marketcap to fall due to external shocks since it started to be traded yet it shows a remarkable trend.  Extrapolations are estimations just that estimations. The only way to extrapolate is to look at the past since you cannot look at the future.  The XKCD joke uses two slights of hand   It ridicules extrapolation based on an extremely shallow sample base   It ridicules extrapolation based on an extremely unlikely continuation marriages  Effective estimation rests on two main pillars   Uses a rich sample base many many sample points  Is applied to data where the estimation into the forseeable future is not obviously impossible or ridiculous.  Bitcoin price estimation somewhat fulfills both these criteria   The bitcoin market capitalization rests on pricing market data which is available in abundance from a variety of sources so the sample basis is fairly good and its getting better as more exchanges chip in.  The price is never by definition ridiculous or impossible. Its just what people agree to exchange.,2014-02-02T11:55:34.000Z,0.25

A huge chunk of the people here digging up dogecoins with their computers are doing it with their home PC that they built to play videogames on.  Whereas every Bitcoin is worth about  are super hard to get ahold of and take forever to mine for the average user it takes about  Dogecoins to equal  right now and even a modest  gaming rig can mine a few bucks worth a day.  That means all of us regular joes are actually accumulating some dogecoin and while we all hope that our dogecoin go up in value TO THE MOON! we also understand that for a cryptocurrency to actually be useful as currency we need to encourage each other to actually use the darn things and not just hoard them like a creepy wierd guy with a basement full of gold coins.  Thats why you seen all these tips and why were so fast to find good causes to spend our Dogecoin on.

People just showed up to get free food provided by that Soros frontgroup and chant the saying everyone else was chanting when they arrived.  Instead become your own personal movement. Gather the knowledge together from your own perspective and to your best abilities. Befriend worthy people who you can depend on. Eat healthy food to have a clear mind and strong body. Exercise so you can handle yourself. Gather together supplies needed to have a few weeks independence from the grocery store and utility company. Consciously channel your dollars to respectable companies and away from immoral ones when you can. Watch. Wait. Listen. Keep a low profile. Then when the time comes....you will be ready. They will miscalculate.  When you gather knowledge and arrive at your own conclusions you will gravitate to certain projects. For one person it may lead to creating or developing a bitcoin business. For another person it will be getting involved in local politics. For another person it will be becoming a scientific researcher. Other people who came to the same conclusions as you will end up in the same little corner of the world as you find yourself while pursuing these endeavors. This is your group with who you work. You will probably belong to several niche groups which may change as your focus shifts as you find new information.

Yet many of the new masses of bitcoin adopters as reflected in the shallow discussions here and the main stream media stories have been thoroughly redirected into this small box of thinking.

Is there a way to get  to your bank account or something else more cashlike to the average person without losing  in fees?  Why would someone bother setting it up even if they could get the full dollar?  Even if they think of holding out until they have like  are they going to set up a walletaccount to receive their first ?  I think the answer is theres nothing really but anyone can take this as a challenge to find something the average person can and would easily obtain with their  tip.  This might even apply up to  for a lot of potential tip recipients.  Maybe you should along with the tip give pointers on how they might spend it if you believe there are such options.  Despite talk of OMG changetip is going viral! this is why I think there is not a lot of genuine activity outside of rbitcoin and similar places.

3604,14.0,0,There is no problem with a large party switching onto PPool  Ppool is timestamped against the bitcoin chain you cant simply blow away the share chain without stopping mining bitcoin... you could if you were malicious exclude other peoples shares but if that happened the attacker could be pretty easily forked around. Since PPools sharechain isnt a financial consensus system forking is no huge deal in theory.  Plus anyone who isnt on ppool now could switch at any second and switch back not using ppool doesnt reduce the risk that you could attack if you turned evil.  Not only that but more hashrate onto ppool will bring even more hashrate if you step on with a somewhat more than half its unlikely that youll be more than half for long.  Dont buy into the FUD people are throwing at you here.  Im one of the earliest big ppool miners and at times in the past Ive been more than half the ppool hashrate.

3608,-5.0,0,I am not looking to do something that in itself is a coin. I believe that bitcoin fails because people took what was supposed to be a passive funding representation the bitcoin and turned it into store of value which is  wrong and completely unstable. I also do not agree with the coin limit placed or the inability to replenish those reserves. The current bitcoin system is  formed and managed as a ponzi. If you remove the smoke and simply provide a proper service protocol then it would at least have some reason for existing.  I also disagree with the blockchain system but I do subscribe to the idea of some sort of distributed computation mechanic that mitigates the need for a central point of failure with transaction verification especially if that means people voluntarily provide computing power to supply the system without the need for costly server farms or real estate and the like. People generally do not use the full potential of their hardware anyways why not put that to use.

3609,-5.0,0,It all depends on what time frame you pick.  Take    and Bitcoin was probably the best investment.  Take the timeframe when bitcoin went from  to  and it was the worst investment.  You can pick any time frame you want and make it fit whatever agenda you want.  But yes I agree  was terrible for Bitcoin I wont deny that.  But what I will say is that we have no idea what could happen in the future.  With that said what I was trying to get at with my original comment is that Russia one of the richest nations and what the author calls a nuclearendowed superpower had its currency tank.  And yes Bitcoin also tanked.  But Bitcoin is not a government currency.  Bitcoin doesnt have millions of people who rely soley on it to run an entire nations economy.  Bitcoin is just a few hundred lines of C code.  A few hundred lines of C code that creates a ledger which random people all over the world volunteered to give a value.  Its just a random bunch of neckbeards in their moms basement money launderers and modernday snakeoil salesmen Well atleast thats what you detractors think anyways... I wont deny that there is some truth to it though.  And this random weird experiment of a free market didnt do so well in .  Big whoop they volunteered to trust Bitcoins ledger over ltinsert every other currency heregt and the freemarket users of Bitcoin burned them in the process  they have no one to blame but themselves.    But heres the thing there is no institution looking after Bitcoin and no one responsible for it to sustain an economy.  On the other hand with every other currency there are large powerful institutions that the users of the institutions currency trust to not fuck up.  And Russia fucked up.  One of the biggest arguments people make against Bitcoin is that it can never be a currency because currencies can only work if they are backed by a government.  Well the ruble was backed by a government and look how its doing as a store of value  not very well.  Millions of people are getting their life savings burned by an institution they trusted.  They didnt volunteer for that  it was out of their control.  In  arbitrary date range Bitcoin a bizaro freemarket volunteer currency only did slightly worse than a government backed currency.  How the fuck was it even close?  How does a currency that has no country backing it even remotely compare to a currency of a superpower?  Yes it did the shittiest out of all currencies in   and it did the shittiest when it went from  to   but Bitcoin is not dead or broken.  Its still trucking along doing its thing and it is still there waiting for anyone to trust it as a store of value.  And the number of people who are starting to trust it as a store of value is continually increasing  even you guys cant deny that.  In conclusion who knows what could happen in the future?  Do you know whats going to happen if another round of bank bailouts comes down the pipeline?  Is the US never going to fuck up the USD?  There is literally no way of knowing if you will be able to trust the USD and the Federal Reserve for the rest of your life.  You have to use faith.    But you know what I can trust?  A few hundred lines of C code and mathematics.  Code that runs completely in the open with a predetermined supply of slots in a ledger.  As seen with  I cant trust the market but I still can trust the code.  Only time will tell whether this trust is misplaced or not.  But using the Bitcoin markets performance of  as rationale to not trusting it at all is in my opinion foolish.  Im sure there were pleanty of people at the bottom of the gt bubble who were laughing at all the people who got burned by the worst investment of ltinsert arbitrary date range heregt.    As a side note if Bitcoin ever does fully crash and burn  ill be the first one to admit I was wrong and come eat all my words here.  Until then cheers ms   Keep on being skeptical.,2014-12-30T05:10:04.000Z,0.25
3610,47.0,0,I dont think Im an authority on the matter but its been an hour and I seem to be the first to reply.  There was a glitch in the MtGox exchange that lets users attempt to modify the bits that were sent and received to withdraw bitcoins that they owned but make it appear as if they had not yet done so. This way they could then withdraw the same bitcoins a second time from MtGox and double the amount of money they had or attempt to modify the bits again and triple their money etc..  A bitcoin exchange has  risks to it  the exchange itself and the bitcoin market. Its hypothetically possible to exchange bitcoins on your own but there are many ways you could mess up and lose a lot of money. Exchanges basically figured this out for you but if they mess up then you cant get your money back. You have to trust the exchange and you are always at the mercy of the bitcoin market.  When this glitch became known people became skeptical about how much money MtGox has lost from these double withdrawal attempts and worried that they would not be able to access their bitcoins again for example if MtGox goes bankrupt. The fear of the exchange failing encouraged those holding bitcoins on the MtGox exchange to sell aggressively and buyers to back away driving the price down.  If the glitch is resolved and MtGox does not declare bankruptcy the bitcoin price on the MtGox exchange will move much closer to the price on other exchanges.,2014-02-15T16:02:54.000Z,0.25

However the fact that it is being used as an investment means it is worthless as a currency.  Currencies at a core are a store of value.

Daytrade it on btce and hope for a pump in the next bitcoin bubble. Thats about it. People are sceptical of bitcoin getting traction in the real world with altcoins will be a very difficult task.  FreeJackk posts like litecoin will be a sure success. Maybe take a look outside your echochamber and get some perspective.

I agree that Bitcoin is a payment method but were kidding ourselves if we think its getting any closer to becoming a currency just because Coinbase signs up another merchant.

3639,0.0,0,Thank you for the response.  . I dont see how thats a concern. Lets say most of the coins are in the hands of few. How does that affect the ability of people to obtain Bitcoin and use it in their everyday life? How does it make it harder for someone to use BTC to buy an Apple? It doesnt make sense. Eventually Bitcoin will be used for a store of wealth digitally or to make transactions not to try and get rich like Im doing. When that point has come your argument isnt valid because it wont make that Apple any more expensive or harder to obtain.  The apple will either be priced in their local currency or fluctuate dependent on what the fair rate for apples will be via BTC on the markets.  . You know what I can almost agree with you on this one. If the majority of media outlets across the world everyday keep bashing and saying that Bitcoin is used for child sex trafficking as its main means for existence that theory might hold true even if they are lying. Especially if they say But look Litecoin isnt used for those purposes!. People are stupid but not too stupid and I think theyd question Well why is Litecoin not used for child sex trafficking but Bitcoin isnt.   . Transaction time isnt a good argument as Ive factually pointed out. Safety features....what...charge back? No that wont work. Then the entire network of  that decentralized coin collapses. Environmental impact if coins can be easily created without much computational work then they have lesser value as you can see in the early Bitcoin days and alts today. Waiting on transactions to confirm are few and far between when a sufficient fee is attached. Consumer wallets will get rid of that problem. Hoarding isnt an issue. When youre hungry youll buy food. When your computer breaks youll buy another. Bitcoin isnt a system where theyre punished unless they spend their money every year. Preventing theft is done via services built on top through consumer services.   These arent valid reasons Im sorry. I only slightly agree with  but I see it as far fetched.,2014-03-03T23:03:22.000Z,0.25

3693,1.0,0,gtDecentralized is not always best. Who are you going to call when you log into your account and see that all of your Bitcoins have been fraudulently removedspent?   Which is why I am glad you are getting your hands on some BTC. Once you get more experience with this technology you will realize it is impossible to have your Bitcoins fraudulently removedspent unless somebody physically breaks into the location that you store your private keys. Unlike a bank account which can be autobilled or your account details hacked the technology behind bitcoin allows for this to not be a problem. The problem comes when people use services like Coinbase as a bank. Bitcoin is meant to be held by the end users not by a rd party. When Bitcoin is held by a rd party it becomes liable to similar problems as traditional banking. You dont own Bitcoins unless you and only you hold the private key.  gt For every young hip tech billionaire that uses cryptocurrency there are  oldfashion billionaires who use real money. If you cant pay for a stay at the Ritz or Four Seasons with Bitcoins if you cant trade on Wall Street with Bitcoins if you cant buy vehicles with Bitcoins the Tesla Bitcoin thing was a marketing gimmick and if you cant buy real estate with Bitcoins then why would anyone with large amounts of real money use Bitcoins?   But you can buy many of these things with Bitcoin and its increasing every single day. Traditional banking is thousands of years old Bitcoin is only . You can buy houses cars everyday goods even trips into low orbit. More and more places accept Crypto.

Just for clarity only  bitcoin was to get traded to ukash and the other  were the loan.  So I would still be owed btc worth just btc would be paid in ukash.  However the next time we talked we agreed to nix the ukash part since I had found somebody else to trade ukash and that btc would just be paid back in bitcoin as well.  I did agree to take btc worth of ukash if he wanted since I had originally agreed to that but he said bitcoin would be easier.  So it was only  btc that was ever a trade for ukash and pretty quickly we reverted to that just being paid back in bitcoin as well.  I consider this a minor detail but apparently it has caused some confusion so I wanted to make everything clear.  The agreement was for bitcoin the original ukash trade was cancelled.,2014-11-16T03:58:58.000Z,0.25

3717,1.0,0,gtIts true Capitalism doesnt require a state although if there is no state its not really capitalism its more anarchocapitalism. But I suppose if you want to call that Capitalism its capitalism although in reality since theres no state then theres no currency enforcement and realistically its not anything.  Anarchocapitalism is the ideal that I would say that I adhere to. The anarcho part denoting obviously to the absence of the state while capitalism being the preferred economic model. From what I see you think that the state is needed for any economic system to exist when this is indeed false. Currency does not require the state as seen with either gold or Bitcoin. The state is not needed for people to trade.  gtLikewise the  observation is interesting but I think Communists and Socialists would argue that its better to not let people suffer and die during bust cycles just for the sake of economic growth.  People die and suffer regardless of the economic system its a matter of lessening the number that do. What communists and socialists are ignorant of is the fact that their system is instead of creating a positive equality simply creates one in which the equality is that all are suffering.  gtWar has also proven quite resilient but that doesnt mean its desirable. Concentration of power social classes racism etc are all various social aspects that have been around more or less forever but that doesnt mean they are good. I dont find this argument particularly compelling.  The difference being however is that capitalism has been a net profit for the world. While war is of course destructive and other human faults are destructive. However capitalism on the other hand has been responsible for a large increase of the standard of living it is a positive on this planet while also interestingly being an amoral system which also in a way sets it apart from the more morality based factors you mention.,2014-11-05T01:02:10.000Z,0.25

3722,1.0,0,Your deposit addresses will not change randomly but your oldest addresses will begin expiring once you have created more than  deposit addresses. In other words if you have  addresses or less they should not expire.  When an address is scheduled to expire its status will show as expiring and the number of days remaining before it expires will be visible on your accounts bitcoin deposit page. The best thing to do is check your account regularly just to make sure that none of your addresses are expiring any time soon.

3765,1.0,0,Yeah but think about how tax refunds work. Your employer estimates the taxes youll owe based on your W and sends part of your paycheck to the government instead. Once a year you calculate what you actually owed and either send the government a check or tell them to send you one.   You can probably find a job now where the employer doesnt send part of your paycheck or report your earnings to the government but youre running legal risks by doing so. That would still probably be the case in a Bitcoin economy. It would be a bit easier to protect your assets and to transfer them without government knowledge but there could still be severe consequences to tax evasion.

3795,1.0,0,gt Dogecoin has rapidly risen in value by  surpassing other Cryptocurrencies in the process. This is likely due to its growing separation from direct reliance on the value of Bitcoin.  What does this even mean? It reads like Dogecoin has increased in value because it has increased its maker cap.  gt The problem facing many Cryptocurrencies at the moment is that they share a mutual dependency on the value of Bitcoin and in my opinion the first ones to establish themselves as a Cryptocurrency that is independent of the failings of Bitcoin and yet still benefit from the overall rise of Crypto itself will be the one to succeed.  This also doesnt really say anything. The popular altcoins are equally susceptible to DoS attacks. As the article claims  gt This dip has been largely attributed to Denialofservice attacks most likely executed by malicious fearmongers deliberately trying to scare the more inexperienced Cryptoinvestors into selling at a low price to the attackers themselves ...

3805,1.0,0,Unfortunately this is why most professional economists see bitcoin enthusiasts as mostly populated by charlatans.  When people are looking for ways to avoid accepting some information that does not fit with their worldview a common tactic is to hyperfocus on something they believe they can explain away which they can then use to discredit the entirety of information presented.  This hyperfocus doesnt need to be rigorous.  In fact it typically begins quite handwavy and this allows the hyperfocus can be a longer diversion pushing all other data deeper away in time.  However this particular divergence you are contending is extremely easy to demonstrate.  That is why it is so widely accepted as truth.   Go to blockchain.info.  Click on Charts and navigate to Total Bitcoins In Circulation and Bitcoin Days Destroyed Cumulative.  Also useful are Market Capitalization Number of Transactions and Number of Unique Addresses Used.  Click All Time in the lower left and download the CSV in the lower right.  Open up the CSVs in a spreadsheet program like Excel.  These are delimited by space and comma and use a date format of ddmmyyyy.  Combine the data from the different graphs on to one spreadsheet for convenience just copy over the relevant data columns next to an existing pair of date time columns.  Make a new column for Bitcoins created on the day.  In Excel this would be done by typing  clicking the current total Bitcoins for that day typing  clicking the previous days total hitting return and then dragging the lower right copy box down the entire column.  Make a column with todays date.  Make another column for the number of days from that row date to today by using  as above.  Make yet another column for the total number of Bitcoin days for the Bitcoins produced that day by multiply Bitcoins produced that day by number of days to today.  Now sum the total Bitcoin days for all Bitcoins produced since the beginning.  For today the total Bitcoin days is .  You can grab that the total cumulative Bitcoin days destroyed is  so the total undestroyed is .  Also the total Bitcoins created total for today is .  So already we have very relevant metrics for measuring holding.  We can see that . of all bitcoin days ever have been undestroyed a huge macroeconomic indication that the currency has strong holding.  Also the average Bitcoin days held per Bitcoin is  a year and a half!  The distribution of bitcoin day consumption is not revealed with this calculation but the mean already pushes large quantities of the currency to lengthy holding particularly since the quantities of coins have grown steadily and the maximum holding time possible is only  days for the  coins available then so tail effects cannot skew the average.  Of course there are other useful metrics one may choose.  If you divide the transactions by the market capitalization you get a macroeconomic metric of the liquidity of transactions that is analysed here,2014-08-23T07:20:26.000Z,0.25

3807,1.0,0,Lake Tahoe Property Sells for . Million in Bitcoins Transaction Is Just One of a Handful to Use the Virtual Currency   gtBy CANDACE JACKSON CONNECT gtAug.    p.m. ET  A site in Truckee Calif. was recently bought with . million in bitcoins. The buyer plans to build a home. Martis Camp A Lake Tahoe property sold Thursday for . millionin bitcoins.  The property is one of just a handful of residential real estate transactions in months that have used virtual currencyand potentially a record in terms of price. The price in bitcoins was .  The .acre acre home site has views of the Pacific Crest a surrounding mountain range. It is located in Martis Camp a private luxury recreational resort in Truckee Calif. The acre resort near Lake Tahoes north shore has a Tom Fazio golf course a seat movie theater and an aerial adventure park with rope courses and a zip line.  Brian Hull Martis Camps director of sales said the buyer was a Silicon Valley entrepreneur but declined to disclose his name. He said the buyer purchased the land through a trust and plans to build a home on the site.  The idea to pay for the Tahoe property with bitcoins came from the buyer said Mr. Hull. When we originally heard the idea of bitcoin everybody had a little pause he said. We werent educated at how the transaction would go.  The digital currency was introduced in  and isnt backed by a central bank or government. It can be created by a computer process known as mining and traded online through unregulated Internet exchanges. The value of bitcoins which began at just pennies has fluctuated over the past few years. The price of a bitcoin topped  in late  but is now around  on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Index and can shift significantly throughout the day.  BitPay an onlinemerchant processor that operates similarly to PayPal or Worldpay handled the Tahoe transaction. Stephanie Wargo BitPays vice president of marketing said about  of the sites merchants are online retailers. Teslas and Lamborghinis have also been purchased with bitcoins through the site.  To transfer property using bitcoins on BitPay the seller creates an invoice for the price of the property either in bitcoin or U.S. dollars as BitPay can pay out in either currency. The bitcoin exchange rate is guaranteed for  minutes after the invoice is created during which the purchaser must complete payment. If the payment isnt completed within the allotted time the exchange rate is recalculated.  In March an anonymous buyer paid  bitcoins or more than  for a twobedroom luxury villa in Bali. In May a home in suburban Kansas City sold for about  in bitcoins through BitPay. BitPay says the Lake Tahoe home site is the most expensive property transaction theyve handled far though not their largest purchase in general.  Several sellers have tried listing their properties in bitcoins including a Las Vegas realestate developer who asked . million for his squarefoot home. He has since taken the property off the market according to his listing agent. BitPremier a website that sells luxury items in exchange for bitcoins has listings for homes including one in Naples Fla. for  . bitcoins and a squarefoot house in the Bighorn Golf Club in Palm Desert Calif. for . million . bitcoins.  As far as I know this would definitely be a record breaker for a publicly disclosed property sale using bitcoins said Alan Silbert CEO of BitPremier which wasnt involved in this deal. The previous record was likely the villa in Bali.  Mr. Hull of Martis Camp said the company is now open to using bitcoin for future sales. Were in the business of dealing with predominantly the Bay Area he said. A lot of our buyer base is in the tech sector and there are a lot of people who have bitcoin holdings.

The answer is that when price goes up and bitcoin goes mainstream the costs to buy bitcoin wont be as expensive and hopefully eventually you wont even need to have fiat currency.   Its the potential gains that help grow bitcoin to a point where it can be mainstream. It is important to sustain the bitcoin ecosystem.,2014-02-13T18:36:12.000Z,0.25

3842,1.0,0,gt if bitcoin becomes more popular wouldnt there be pressure to produce more of it?  Who would be feeling this pressure to produce more?  Nobody is in control of Bitcoin.  Owners of Bitcoin dont want more of it to be produced because that will deflate the value of their Bitcoins and last time I checked people were not interested in losing money.  So the truth of the matter is that there is pressure to maintain the fixed supply.  Besides nobody is in charge of Bitcoin nobody can suddenly decide to produce more of it.  In order for that to happen the majority of network nodes and miners would have to agree to such a change which would be against their best interests.    gtOne of the primary reasons we abandoned gold for fiat was that it was more useful for creating liquidity during times of innovation whereas gold and fixed currencies get hoarded and lead to price manipulation.

3850,1.0,0,There are two ways to solve for the private key by solving for it in the signature or by solving for it from the public key. Both require computing a discrete logarithm over an ellipticcurve group which is an operation for which we currently have no efficient algorithm capable of running on a classical computer. If you know that the private key was derived from a seed with less entropy than the size of the key itself then your search space is reduced. This could mean that a future partial compromise of ECDSA could render your lowentropy keys vulnerable to attack when highentropy keys would still be safe. It could also mean that a future quantum computer would not need as many qbits to solve for your lowentropy key as would be needed to solve for a highentropy key.  In general if you have the option of using  bits of entropy to produce a bit key and there is no appreciable advantage to using less entropy then you should use  bits of entropy. The reason some Bitcoin standards proposals use bit seeds is to reduce the number of words that must be written down and subsequently reentered by a human user. Its a tradeoff of security for convenience. If there is no additional workinconvenience for a human to use  bits of entropy then that should be preferred.,2014-10-21T01:03:28.000Z,0.25

3866,1.0,0,gt How can banks perform FRB with Bitcoin?  You cant do any lending without FRB.  A person who lends has to be holding a financial instrument of some kind be it a security draft loan etc.  All of these things are included in the money supply because they all are paid in the same base currency and devalue the demand  increase the supply of that base currency.  It works just like any other financial market.  In a Bitcoin world you deposit your Bitcoins into a bank or investment firm where they pay you interest.  They then give out those Bitcoins through loans.  The bank holds Loans and you hold ownership over your bank account.  People who just hold their own wallets are like people who just hold cash.  You get no interest but your Bitcoins are devalued by the issuance of these other Bitcoinfinancial instruments.  Eventually Banks dont even bother giving out Bitcoins  you get a loan as a check drafted by the bank itself valued in Bitcoins.  Other banks will cash this check and credit your interestpaying account.  They will let you withdraw your account in Bitcoins or even Dollars but the value is indexed to Bitcoins because the loans they hold are being paid in Bitcoins plus the extra interest they earn.  Just like today banks wont even need to lend out or hold Bitcoins.  Their assets are Bitcoin financial instruments and the loans they issue are deposited at other institutions valued in Bitcoins.  If they need Bitcoins or Reserves they just borrow them from the creditdeposits at other banks.,2014-06-03T02:34:10.000Z,0.25

For a large part of my life I lived in ignorance too Im not referring to you here  not caring how things worked but just how it affects me and what I could do about it.  I feel a lot of people are the same with things in general not just currency  they only care if it makes a direct impact on their life. Sometimes  though  things can make a serious impact on your life and the problem is complicated enough that people just neglect it  like the devaluation of a currency base  because of deregulation  yet people still dont take an interest  even though their lives and assets are being robbed. They will even go as far as to call you paranoid or flat out to refuse to accept the reality.. Maybe even heavily criticise the solution and associate it with crime and paedophilia like OPs post  this is ignorance and its something I try really hard with people to help them understand but I just get the glazed look I dont want to step on anyones toes and be hated for it I want to preserve my sanity and Id rather not be known as some kind of social outcast quack.  Life sure is a difficult game and people make it nearly impossible to do the right thing..  To learn and grow.. Because everyone has their stupid little answers to problems created out of thin air with their less than expert opinion. All too happy to offer up their opinions that do more harm than good.  Thats a huge problem with westerners  they think they have some entitlement to always be giving out an experts opinion on literally everything.. Most people offer up advice and opinions when they have less than twenty minutes experience in something. I wish people would just realise that we are all ignorant but some of use have real answers to real problems.. Answers that werent made up on the spot.. But drowned out by mediocrity.

3881,1.0,0,More precisely the Bitcoin network now costs  BTC per day and will continue to cost that much until the reward is halved in .    That cost is paid by an inflation tax that indirectly hits all bitcoin holders.  Currently it means that the people who buy or trade bitcoins must put . million dollars into the system just to maintain the network.  It is hard to separate that loss from price changes due to other causes but it surely contributes to the devaluation that bitcoin has suffered in .  Part of that . million USday goes into paying the actual costs of mining equipment rent electricity salaries etc. and part goes into the miners pockets as profits.  It is unclear how profitable mining is at present. However since it is a free market if the price remains minimally stable for a year or so the industry should adjust so that the profits are  of the revenue not much more.  Therefore a rough guess for the actual cost of the network minus miners profits today is about  million USday.  With the present traffic that is about  per transaction or  of the total transaction amount excluding obvious changebacks.    It is hard to guess what the cost per transaction or more importantly per BTC transferred will be when the inflation tax is replaced by transition fees as the main revenue source for the miners network.  It depends on an unpredictable variable which is the total daily transaction volume in USD at the time.    The fees then can be expected to be around  of the transaction amount to maximize the miners revenue while keeping the system competitive with other forms of payment.  However  at least  of the current traffic seems to be bogus transactions where the coins do not change owner.  Once fees become significant most of that bogus traffic will probably vanish.,2014-12-28T18:25:44.000Z,0.25

3887,1.0,0,Except that when all the alts are traded in bitcoin as its market cap goes down so does the market cap of the alts even without anyone selling off any alts. The altbtc ratio is more important in this regard than marketcap because even if no one sells a single dogecoin to exchange for bitcoin to exchange for fiat the market cap of doge goes down with bitcoin if the ratio stays equal. I was looking and it seems that only a few have fallen much more percentagewise than bitcoin and that is no more than normal.,2014-02-25T09:01:51.000Z,0.25

3893,1.0,0,gt The Mt. Gox saga is simply a reflection of the most problematic aspects of the centralized financial trust model and the deepening crisis of legitimacy it has spawned. It has been a very hard but invaluable lesson for the cryptocurrency world. Trying to fit Bitcoin in the framework of trust vested in a powerful authority shows a basic lack of understanding of this innovation.  This is a great article. And a good example of how bloggers often provide significant higher quality writing when compared to publications like the NYT.  Bitcoin allows us to take centralized and unaccountable trust out of the system. MtGox is an example that did the reverse. It was a recipe for disaster. Lets evolve the road is clear.,2014-03-01T20:14:37.000Z,0.25

In a piramid scheme there is no underlying value in Bitcoin there is an underlying value the payment network.  Again if you want to argue that there is a bubble show that there is much more value attributed to the network than there will be in the future.  Its almost impossible. Thats why any sane Bitcoiner will tell you not to invest more than you can afford to lose and its a speculative investment.  Dont act like you know it all. Bitcoin can fail it can thrive the future will tell.,2014-04-11T08:05:23.000Z,0.25

3900,1.0,0,Heres an opposing thought. I dont even think Bitcoin is gonna used in the digital currency world to buy a cup of coffee. I see it rather as the base of value that gives all other alt coins value.  It already has kind of done that. Now putting this into perspective look at how doge gets tossed around. There will be another currency like doge that will be accepted as normal currency to use.  Which in turn might make BTC even More valuable.  Im already betting on Bitcoin  not being used and being a gold bar of sorts.  Not to mention youre owning a piece of the greatest technologies thats ever  sprouted out of the internet age.,2014-03-08T16:50:03.000Z,0.25
3901,1.0,0,The meaning of cheap.  Consider the number of coins is arbitrary.   million or  billion.  Think of it as ONE single coin.  What  do you own of that coin for a dollar.  That shows you if it is cheap that doesnt mean that there is value in every coin that comes out.  Copy cats may be cheap but if they dont perform a niche or have infrastructure then they are cheap AND worthless.  But consider the case of Vertcoin.  It is VERY cheap compared to bitcoin and will have a huge following until the next better decentralized mining coin takes its thunder.  So what  of a centralized ASIC coin can you own for  and what  of a decentralized GPU coin can you get for .  I would personally value the GPU coin.  Because ASIC is a waste of manufacturing hardware and GPU can be used for computers after the miner gives up and sells the gear.  That means less waste.  So the value is based on what  you can get of the WHOLE who cares about how many arbitrary units of the coin you aquire and its functional values.,2014-04-06T17:23:00.000Z,0.25

3905,1.0,0,Some points.  Those of us who understand how Bitcoin works immediately understand that the story as presented by SR was cute but completely unrealistic.   of the SR. admins were arrested late December but the site magically remained up.  Many of us have suspected that the site has been a honeypot since that point in time.  The real figure of coins gone missing from SR was probably closer to k. We have no idea what the real number is all we can say for sure is that the cute defcon story is hogwash and that we should put zero weight on his figure.  The SR hack just happened to come the day after the police took down Utopia which was their biggest competitor.  There is no way to know for sure if SR was a US government black operation and they simply decided to take all the funds there which was all drug money anyway or it was run by some other group who decided to cash out and go  the day after Utopia was taken down. I view the first alternative as the far more likely one. I have a greater understanding as to how both Tor and Bitcoin works than most and see the SR story as ridiculous at best  but I do get why people who dont understand the technical details would believe their cute little story.,2014-02-19T11:26:22.000Z,0.25
3906,1.0,0,was the year of Arab Spring protests and governments shutting down internet and cell phone access. The original device idea was going to provide its own mesh network and could be charged by solar. It would allow texting in areas without any infrastructure support whatsoever allowing protesters to organize or people in very poor and remote parts of the world to communicate. Now the goal is to be able to use bitcoin very easily on a cheap secure device and without the need for a data connection. So its useful for regular users who dont want to store bitcoins on their phones and just use a card to pay with users who dont have a data connection travelers who are outside of their cell plan area and we could drop a box of these on some remote village in the middle of Africa or India and as long as one person has a cell phone connected to the blockchain everyone in the village can use bitcoin.,2014-12-26T20:23:46.000Z,0.25

3938,1.0,0,so i have a server. if it need maintenance i have to unplug it and do maintenance. now suppose instead i had TWO servers. i can shut one down while the other one keeps running and then start it up then shut the other down. now you may ask what about the people connected to the server you are shutting down wont they have to reconnect why yes dear reader they would. so lets add a third server. ok this server is smaller and only serves to be a single point of connection. so when someone requests red_hot_linux.pdf from my server i pick one of the servers and i request the file from them they send it to me and i send it to you. i pick the least used server or just pick the next in a list round robin style this is known as load balancing.   now lets go back to that scenario. i am shutting down the second server to do maintenance but that PDF is still being sent to the load balancer. have no fear when the connection is broke the load balancer simply gets the remaining bytes from the other server since the data is duplicated on each server and synchronized regularly and keeps sending to the user.  now if my maintenance was just replacing a dead server or some blown memory or a dead disk drive i could plug it back in when i finished run a sync and be up and going. but if i had to take it down to change the code...well now its different from the other server. if i want to keep people from being inconvenienced i need to handle this transition carefully. so i get another server! this one is a loadbalancer like the previous one but it only has one node to balance. why bother you may ask? because at some point it will have more and we dont wanna have to take the server down to do this.   so now we have our second server its got the new code and its brand spanking new and we want everyone to go to it. so we tell the router to route all new data destined to the old load balancer to go to the new one. everyone still getting data off the old server can keep doing so but all new requests go to the new server. eventually no one is using the old server so we sync it with the other server so now its got the same code and we add it to the new load balancer. now we have done a seamless rollout.  OR if we dont care about some inconveniences we just do the update at like  in the morning when no one is online. its cheaper and few people complain anyways.  google has a lot of servers a lot of load balancers and geographic dispersion. reddit has like a dell they keep in a refrigerator. google has billions of dollars reddit has a stamp collection and a bitcoin.,2014-05-10T03:21:38.000Z,0.25
